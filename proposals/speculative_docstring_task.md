# Speculative Task Proposal: Add Missing Docstrings

**Objective:** To improve the quality and maintainability of the codebase by adding a missing module-level docstring to `tooling/pre_submit_check.py`.

**Rationale:** The unified documentation builder, as described in `README.md`, identified that `tooling/pre_submit_check.py` and `tooling/file_indexer.py` were missing docstrings. However, `tooling/file_indexer.py` does not exist, so this proposal will focus on the remaining file. Adding the docstring will improve code clarity, make the system easier to understand for other agents and human developers, and bring the file into compliance with the project's documentation standards. This task aligns with the overall goal of continuous self-improvement.

**Plan:**
1.  Analyze `tooling/pre_submit_check.py` to understand its functionality and add a descriptive module-level docstring.
2.  Request user review of the changes, in accordance with the `user-review-gate` rule of the Speculative Execution protocol.
