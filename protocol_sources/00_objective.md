# Subject: Jules Agent Protocol v3.0

## 1. Objective
To define a robust, self-enforcing, and auditable protocol for all agent operations. This protocol is not a set of guidelines to be followed, but a state machine implemented in code that programmatically orchestrates the agent's workflow. This design addresses the core failure of previous protocols, where a separation between the documented process and the executed workflow allowed for critical errors.
