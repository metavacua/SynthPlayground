"""
A unified, constraint-based interface for all research and data-gathering operations.

This script abstracts the various methods an agent might use to gather information
(reading local files, accessing the web, querying a database) into a single,
standardized function: `execute_research_protocol`. It is a core component of
the Advanced Orientation and Research Protocol (AORP), providing the mechanism
by which the agent fulfills the requirements of each orientation level (L1-L4).

The function operates on a `constraints` dictionary, which specifies the target,
scope, and other parameters of the research task. This design allows the calling
orchestrator (e.g., `master_control.py`) to request information without needing
to know the underlying implementation details of how that information is fetched.

This script is designed to be executed by a system that has pre-loaded the
following native tools into the execution environment:
- `read_file(filepath: str) -> str`
- `list_files(path: str = ".") -> list[str]`
- `google_search(query: str) -> str`
- `view_text_website(url: str) -> str`

    """
    Executes a research task based on a dictionary of constraints.

    This function delegates to native, pre-loaded tools based on the specified
    target and scope.

    Args:
        constraints: A dictionary specifying the operational parameters.
            - target: 'local_filesystem', 'external_web', 'external_repository', or 'knowledge_graph'.
            - scope: 'file', 'directory', 'narrow', 'broad', or 'enrich'.
            - path: The file or directory path for local filesystem operations.
            - query: The search term for web research.
            - url: The specific URL for direct web access.
            - input_graph_path: Path to the source knowledge graph.
            - output_graph_path: Path to save the enriched knowledge graph.

    Returns:
        A string containing the result of the research operation.
