    """
    A placeholder for a unified, constraint-based research tool.

    This function simulates the behavior of the deep research tool by inspecting
    the `constraints` dictionary and returning a mock response appropriate for
    each AORP level (L1-L4). This provides a functional, testable hook for
    the protocol without requiring a live service.

    Args:
        constraints: A dictionary specifying the operational parameters for the
                     research task, defining the "level" of research.

    Returns:
        A string representing the result of the research operation.
