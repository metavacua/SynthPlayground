"""
Scans the repository for dependency files and generates a unified dependency graph.

This script is a crucial component of the agent's environmental awareness,
providing a clear map of the software supply chain. It recursively searches the
entire repository for common dependency management files, specifically:
- `package.json` (for JavaScript/Node.js projects)
- `requirements.txt` (for Python projects)

It parses these files to identify two key types of relationships:
1.  **Internal Dependencies:** Links between different projects within this repository.
2.  **External Dependencies:** Links to third-party libraries and packages.

The final output is a JSON file, `knowledge_core/dependency_graph.json`, which
represents these relationships as a graph structure with nodes (projects and
dependencies) and edges (the dependency links). This artifact is a primary
input for the agent's orientation and planning phases, allowing it to reason
about the potential impact of its changes.
