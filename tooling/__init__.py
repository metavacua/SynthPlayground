"""
This module contains the various tools and utilities that support the agent's
development, testing, and operational workflows.

The tools in this package are the building blocks of the agent's capabilities,
ranging from code analysis and refactoring to protocol compilation and
self-correction. Each script is designed to be a self-contained unit of
functionality that can be invoked either from the command line or programmatically
by the agent's master control system.

This __init__.py file marks the 'tooling' directory as a Python package,
allowing for the organized import of its various modules.
