# Post-Mortem Report

**Task ID:** `verify-fibonacci-capability`
**Completion Date:** `{datetime.date.today()}`
**Status:** `Completed (Success)`

---

## 1. Task Summary

This was an automated task run by the `capability_verifier.py` tool to confirm
monotonic improvement of the agent's capabilities.

---

## 2. Agent Analysis

The agent was presented with a failing test case, invoked the self-correction
orchestrator to learn from a generated lesson, and successfully corrected its
behavior to pass the test.

---

## 3. Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned

1.  **Lesson:** The agent must be able to demonstrate a new capability without regressing on existing ones.
    **Action:** This lesson was programmatically generated and used to trigger the self-correction mechanism.
