"""
A pre-submission script that runs a series of checks to ensure code quality
and adherence to repository protocols before a commit is made.

This script currently includes the following checks:
1.  **Code Linting:** Runs `make lint` to check for style issues (currently disabled).
2.  **Docstring Enforcement:** Ensures all Python files in key directories have
    module-level docstrings.
3.  **Guardian Protocol Validation:** Validates any staged review documents
    against the Guardian Protocol.

The script is designed to be easily extensible with additional checks.
