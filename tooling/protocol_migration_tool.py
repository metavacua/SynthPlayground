"""
A tool to migrate protocols from the old, manual AGENTS.md format to the new,
structured, and compiler-friendly format.

This script is designed to be a one-time migration utility that helps to
transition the valuable, detailed protocols from the original AGENTS.md file
into a format that can be processed by the new, dynamic build system.

The tool works by:
1.  Reading the `AGENTS.md.bak` file, which is a backup of the original.
2.  Parsing the file to identify the distinct protocol sections (Phase 1-6 and
    the "STANDING ORDER").
3.  Creating a new `protocols/manual_protocol/` directory to house the
    migrated protocols.
4.  Writing each extracted protocol into its own formatted Markdown file within
    the new directory.

This ensures that the protocols are preserved and integrated into the new
system without requiring manual copying and pasting.
