"""
Defines the core data structures for managing the agent's state.

This module provides the `AgentState` and `PlanContext` dataclasses, which are
fundamental to the operation of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC). These
structures allow the `master_control.py` orchestrator to maintain a complete,
snapshot-able representation of the agent's progress through a task.

- `AgentState`: The primary container for all information related to the current
  task, including the plan execution stack, message history, and error states.
- `PlanContext`: A specific structure that holds the state of a single plan
  file, including its content and the current execution step. This is the
  element that gets pushed onto the `plan_stack` in `AgentState`.

Together, these classes enable the hierarchical, stack-based planning and
execution that is the hallmark of the CFDC.

class AgentState:
    """
    Represents the complete, serializable state of the agent's workflow.

    This dataclass acts as a central container for all information related to the
    agent's current task. It is designed to be passed between the different states
    of the `MasterControlGraph` FSM, ensuring that context is maintained
    throughout the lifecycle of a task.

    Attributes:
        task: A string describing the overall objective.
        plan_path: The file path to the root plan for the current task.
        plan_stack: A list of `PlanContext` objects, forming the execution
            stack for the CFDC. The plan at the top of the stack is the one
            currently being executed.
        messages: A history of messages, typically for interaction with an LLM.
        orientation_complete: A flag indicating if the initial orientation
            phase has been successfully completed.
        vm_capability_report: A string summarizing the results of the
            environmental probe.
        research_findings: A dictionary to store the results of research tasks.
        draft_postmortem_path: The file path to the draft post-mortem report
            generated during the AWAITING_ANALYSIS state.
        final_report: A string containing a summary of the final, completed
            post-mortem report.
        error: An optional string that holds an error message if the FSM
            enters an error state, providing a clear reason for the failure.
