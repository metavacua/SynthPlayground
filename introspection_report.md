# Introspection Report

This report summarizes the findings from a deeper introspection into the agent's own operational history.

## 1. Planning Efficiency Analysis

- **Action:** Executed the `self_improvement_cli.py` tool to analyze the historical log data for tasks with multiple `set_plan` events.
- **Outcome:** The analysis identified one task with multiple plan revisions:
  - **Task ID:** `task-2bc79ace-1a93-4354-a01d-b6d728d6d7bd` (the current reflection task)
  - **Reason:** The plan was revised during the initial "reflection" phase after a code review revealed a discrepancy between the reflection report and the implemented changes. This is an example of a justified plan change in response to new information.

## 2. Protocol Violation Analysis

- **Action:** Executed the `self_improvement_cli.py` tool to scan the logs for any instances of critical protocol violations.
- **Outcome:** The analysis found no instances of critical protocol violations, such as the use of the forbidden `reset_all` tool.

## Conclusion

The introspection analysis reveals a healthy operational history. The agent is adhering to critical protocols and is using its planning tools appropriately. The single instance of a multi-revision plan was a necessary correction in response to feedback, which demonstrates a healthy self-correction loop rather than an inefficiency.
