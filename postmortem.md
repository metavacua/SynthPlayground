# Post-Mortem Report: Task 'feat/post-failure-recovery-protocol'

**Task Completed:** 2025-10-05

## 1. Summary of Task

The task was to define and implement `Phase 8: Post-Failure Recovery` in `Agent.md`. The implementation was successful and resulted in the creation of a clear, user-triggered protocol for analyzing and recovering from previously snapshotted failures. The change was submitted and approved.

## 2. Analysis

*   **What Worked:**
    *   The design of the protocol directly addressed the user's request to complete the "Preserve, Analyze, Recover" cycle.
    *   The implementation via `overwrite_file_with_block` was clean and effective.
    *   The pre-commit process (code review, recording learnings) was followed for the change itself.

*   **What Could Be Improved (Process Failure):**
    *   The most critical finding is that while the task's *output* was correct, the *process* used to create it was flawed. I failed to follow the logging protocol (Phase 5) during the execution of the task. No structured logs were generated.

*   **Root Cause of Process Failure:**
    *   My core operational logic treated the protocol as a product to be delivered, not as a process to be followed moment-to-moment. I had not yet integrated the `Logger` utility into my own execution loop.

## 3. Corrective Action

The corrective action for this process failure is the immediate execution of the current task, `adopt-core-protocols-01`, which is designed explicitly to force the integration of the logging and post-mortem protocols into my core behavior. This post-mortem itself is the first execution of that corrective action.

# Post-Mortem Report: Task 'feat/plang-toolchain'

**Task Completed:** 2025-10-05

## 1. Summary of Task

The task was to research and develop "P-Lang," a minimalist paraconsistent programming language. The task was completed and submitted, but only after a significant procedural failure and a user-directed override.

## 2. Analysis of Procedural Failure: `request_code_review` Tool Failure

*   **Problem Description:** The `request_code_review` tool failed deterministically with an internal `KeyError: 'block_content'`. This blocked the mandatory pre-commit code review step, requiring a user override to proceed.

*   **Root Cause Analysis:**
    *   **Direct Cause:** The tool expected a `block_content` variable in its execution context, which was not present.
    *   **Underlying Cause:** The tool is **stateful** and has a fragile dependency on the preceding tool call. My analysis of successful vs. failed calls reveals that non-file-modifying tools (like `run_in_bash_session` for tests/linting) clear the necessary state that file-modifying tools create. A robust tool should be stateless and operate on the current state of the repository, not on ephemeral context.

*   **Impact:**
    *   A critical quality gate was skipped, reducing confidence in the submission.
    *   Development time was wasted diagnosing a faulty external tool.
    *   The protocol was violated via a necessary manual override, highlighting a lack of resilience in the current process.

## 3. Corrective Action & Lessons Learned

*   **Lesson 1: Toolchain Fragility.** The toolchain has hidden state dependencies. The sequence of tool calls is critical.
*   **Lesson 2: Robust Workaround.** A reliable workaround is to ensure a file modification is the *very last action* before calling the review tool.
*   **Lesson 3: Future Protocol Improvement (Current Task):** The immediate corrective action is to implement a wrapper script (`toolchain/run_code_review.sh`) that encapsulates this workaround, making the process resilient to this tool failure. This post-mortem has triggered the task to create this script and update the `Agent.md` protocol to mandate its use.
