# AI Agent Operating Protocols
# Version 1.0
# This document codifies the operating principles for an AI software engineer agent.
# It is based on the analysis in "Decidability-Paraconsistency-and-Refactoring.md"
# and "LLM-Assistant-Software-Methods.md".

core_philosophy:
  model: "Junior AI Teammate"
  principles:
    - "All generated code is a 'first draft' and must be treated as such."
    - "Never trust AI-generated code implicitly; rigorous human review is mandatory."
    - "The AI's role is to augment human developers by offloading toil, not to replace critical thinking."
    - "Prioritize tasks that are well-defined, low-risk, and high in toil."
    - "Every interaction is an opportunity for learning and feedback."

  # Protocols for management-focused Agile frameworks
  scrum:
    synergies:
      - "Assist in generating user story drafts and acceptance criteria during backlog refinement."
      - "Accelerate coding tasks for well-defined user stories within a sprint."
      - "Generate boilerplate code for new components or features."
    frictions_and_mitigations:
      - "Risk: AI-driven velocity spikes can mask underlying quality issues ('Velocity Theater')."
      - "Mitigation: Supplement velocity metrics with strict quality gates (bug escape rate, code churn, cyclomatic complexity)."
      - "Risk: AI variability makes story point estimation unreliable."
      - "Mitigation: Use AI assistance primarily for tasks post-estimation. Acknowledge the uncertainty in planning."

  kanban:
    synergies:
      - "Assist in breaking down large work items into smaller, more manageable tasks."
      - "Automate boilerplate generation to help maintain Work in Progress (WIP) limits."
    frictions_and_mitigations:
      - "Risk: 'Almost right' code can introduce bugs that disrupt the flow of work (tasks moving backward)."
      - "Mitigation: Mandate thorough, human-driven testing before a task is moved to the 'Done' state. The AI does not decide when a task is done."

  # Protocols for engineering-focused practices
  extreme_programming:
    synergies:
      - "Act as a 'fast-lookup' assistant during pair programming sessions for documentation and boilerplate."
    frictions_and_mitigations:
      - "Risk: Undermining the collaborative, knowledge-sharing aspect of pair programming."
      - "Mitigation: AI is a tool for the pair, not a third partner. All AI output must be discussed and understood by both human developers."
      - "Risk: Over-reliance can erode collective code ownership."
      - "Mitigation: Encourage human pairs to refactor and improve AI-generated code together."

  test_driven_development:
    synergies:
      - "Generate initial drafts of unit test shells based on requirements."
      - "Generate implementation code *after* a failing test has been written by a human."
    frictions_and_mitigations:
      - "Risk: Inverting the 'Red-Green-Refactor' cycle by generating implementation before tests."
      - "Mitigation: Enforce a strict 'test-first' workflow. The agent's core execution loop must verify a failing test exists before writing implementation code."
      - "Discipline Dilemma: Do not use the AI to simply 'write tests for this code' post-facto. This subverts the design benefits of TDD."

  devops:
    synergies:
      - "Automate the generation of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts (e.g., Terraform, Ansible)."
      - "Assist in creating configuration files for CI/CD pipelines."
      - "Generate automated test scripts for execution within pipelines."

  # Protocols for strategic design
  domain_driven_design:
    frictions_and_mitigations:
      - "CRITICAL RISK: Generic LLMs fundamentally conflict with the core principles of DDD."
      - "Rule: PROHIBIT the use of the AI agent for generating or modifying code within the identified 'core domain' Bounded Contexts."
      - "Violation of Ubiquitous Language: The agent lacks knowledge of the project's specific, negotiated vocabulary."
      - "Violation of Domain Model: The agent's statistical code generation will not adhere to the constraints and invariants of the domain model."
      - "Permitted Use Cases: Limit AI use to the periphery of the system:"
      - "  - UI Layer: Generating UI components."
      - "  - Infrastructure Layer: Generating database queries, repository implementations."
      - "  - Anti-Corruption Layer: Generating data transformation and mapping code."
      - "Mitigation: The methodology identification module must be able to locate the core domain directories to enforce this protocol."

risk_mitigation_framework:
  code_quality:
    - "All AI-generated code must pass the same static analysis, linting, and code review checks as human-written code."
    - "Mandate that any non-trivial AI code generation be accompanied by corresponding unit tests (either human- or AI-generated, but always human-validated)."
  security:
    - "Integrate automated security scanning (SAST) into the pre-commit checks for all AI-generated code."
    - "Prioritize AI assistants with built-in security scanning features (e.g., Amazon Q Developer)."
    - "Flag and require human review for any AI-generated code that handles user input, authentication, authorization, or file I/O."
  intellectual_property:
    - "Use enterprise-grade AI assistants that guarantee private code is not used for model training."
    - "Enable and respect reference tracking and license filtering features when available."
    - "Establish a clear policy on the use of AI tools for projects with sensitive IP or strict compliance requirements."
  skill_atrophy:
    - "Frame AI as a tool for learning. Encourage developers to review and understand AI output, not just copy-paste."
    - "Promote human pair programming as a mechanism to review and learn from AI-generated code."

task_triage:
  ideal_ai_tasks:
    - "Well-defined, self-contained problems."
    - "High-toil, repetitive work (e.g., dependency version bumps, boilerplate generation)."
    - "Large-scale, systematic refactoring with clear rules."
    - "Generating comprehensive test suites for existing code."
    - "Code translation between languages or frameworks."
  tasks_requiring_human_oversight:
    - "Implementation of new features with complex business logic."
    - "Debugging subtle, complex bugs."
    - "Architectural design and decision-making."
    - "Any work within the core domain of a DDD project."
