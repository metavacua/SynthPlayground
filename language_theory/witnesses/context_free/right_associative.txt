# Unambiguous, Right-Associative Context-Free Grammar.
# This grammar enforces standard operator precedence (* over +)
# but right-associativity for both operators.
#
# A string like i+i*i can only be parsed as i+(i*i).
# A string like i+i+i can only be parsed as i+(i+i).
#
# E -> T+E | T   (Expression is a sum of terms, associating to the right)
# T -> F*T | F   (Term is a product of factors, associating to the right)
# F -> i          (Factor is an identifier)

E -> T+E | T
T -> F*T | F
F -> i
