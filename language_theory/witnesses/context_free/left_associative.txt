# Unambiguous, Left-Associative Context-Free Grammar.
# This grammar enforces standard operator precedence (* over +)
# and left-associativity for both operators.
#
# A string like i+i*i can only be parsed as i+(i*i).
# A string like i+i+i can only be parsed as (i+i)+i.
#
# E -> E+T | T   (Expression is a sum of terms)
# T -> T*F | F   (Term is a product of factors)
# F -> i          (Factor is an identifier)

E -> E+T | T
T -> T*F | F
F -> i
