# Corrected Left-Linear Grammar for the language a^n b^m where n, m > 0
# e.g., ab, aab, abbb
# This grammar is systematically derived from the right-linear grammar for the reversed language.
# Productions are of the form A -> Bt or A -> t.

# S: Start symbol
# B: Builds the b's from right-to-left
# A: Builds the a's from right-to-left

S -> Bb
B -> Bb | Aa
A -> Aa | a
