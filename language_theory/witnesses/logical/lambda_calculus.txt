# A Context-Free Grammar for the (Untyped) Lambda Calculus
#
# This grammar generates syntactically well-formed lambda calculus terms.
# It serves as a witness for a language that is itself a universal
# model of computation, corresponding to a non-classical logic.
#
# We use 'L' to represent the lambda (Î») symbol.
