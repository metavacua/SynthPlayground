# A Simple Grammar with a Contracting Rule
#
# This grammar generates the simple regular language L = {a+}.
# However, it does so using a contracting (Type-0) rule (C -> ).
# This demonstrates a grammar that is structurally unrestricted, even though
# the language it generates is simple and decidable.
