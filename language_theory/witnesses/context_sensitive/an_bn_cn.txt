# Context-Sensitive Grammar for the language L = {a^n b^n c^n | n >= 1}
# This is a classic example of a language that is context-sensitive but not context-free.
#
# The key rule is `CB -> BC`, which allows the Bs and Cs to be sorted.
# This rule is context-sensitive because the replacement of C depends on its right-context (B)
# and the replacement of B depends on its left-context (C).

S -> aSBC | aBC
CB -> BC
aB -> ab

bC -> bc
