# Context-Sensitive Grammar for the language L = {a^n b^n c^n | n >= 1}
# This is a classic example of a language that is context-sensitive but not context-free.
#
# The key rule is `C B -> B C`, which allows the Bs and Cs to be sorted.
# This rule is context-sensitive because the replacement of C depends on its right-context (B)
# and the replacement of B depends on its left-context (C).
# Symbols on both sides of a rule are separated by spaces for robust parsing.

S -> a S B C | a B C
C B -> B C
a B -> a b
b B -> b b
b C -> b c
c C -> c c
