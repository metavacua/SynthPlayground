# Post-Mortem Report: Modality-Aware FDC Toolchain

**Task ID:** `feature/fdc-modality-analyzer`
**Completion Date:** `2025-10-06`

## 1. Task Summary

The objective of this task was to integrate the concept of FDC Modality into the protocol and toolchain. This involved defining "Analysis (Read-Only)" and "Construction (Read-Write)" modalities in `AGENTS.md` and upgrading the `fdc_cli.py analyze` subcommand to classify plans accordingly. The task was successful, but its execution revealed and forced the correction of several deep, critical bugs in the underlying FDC validator and formal model, ultimately leading to a significantly more robust and reliable system.

## 2. Process Analysis

### What Went Well
*   **Protocol-Driven Bug Discovery:** The process itself was the hero of this task. Adhering to the protocol of testing every component (`validate`, `analyze`) against every test case (`constant`, `polynomial`, `exptime`, etc.) was what uncovered the critical bugs. The `validate` command failing on the `analysis_plan.txt` and later on the `invalid_plan.txt` were not setbacks, but crucial successes of the formal process we have built.
*   **Systematic Corrective Action:** When critical failures were discovered, I correctly halted the current plan and formulated new, targeted corrective plans. This demonstrates a mature, protocol-driven response to failure, prioritizing correctness over expediency.
*   **Successful Final Implementation:** The final, corrected toolchain is now demonstrably robust. It correctly validates and analyzes plans of all defined complexity classes and modalities, and the formal model at its core is now much more precise.

### What Could Be Improved
*   **Initial Validator Flaw:** The initial version of the semantic validator had a major design flaw: it did not account for pre-existing files. This was a significant oversight that should have been caught during the initial design phase of that feature.
*   **Flawed FSM Granularity:** The initial FSM was not granular enough, using a generic `process_op` that allowed invalid state transitions. This was a flaw in the formal model itself, which indicates a need for more rigorous upfront analysis when designing such systems.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause of the failures during this task was a series of cascading simplifying assumptions made during previous development cycles. I assumed the validator only needed to track files created *within* a plan, and I assumed a generic FSM action type was "good enough" for process control. Both assumptions were proven false by the rigorous testing mandated by the protocol. This entire task has been an exercise in discovering and correcting these latent flaws, hardening the system by making its implicit assumptions explicit and robust.

## 3. Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned

1.  **Trust the Protocol, Especially When It Fails:** This task has been the ultimate proof of the protocol's value. The failures it produced were not noise; they were signals that pointed directly to the weakest parts of the system. The key lesson is to treat every validation failure as a critical insight into a flawed assumption.
2.  **Regression Testing is Non-Negotiable:** After every significant fix (like the initial file state scan or the FSM refinement), the decision to re-run the *entire* test suite was critical. It's the only way to ensure a fix in one area does not cause an unexpected break in another. This must be a standard procedure for all future bug fixes.
3.  **Formal Models Must Be Precise:** The failure of the `invalid_plan.txt` test demonstrated that a formal model is only as good as its precision. A generic, permissive FSM is almost as bad as no FSM at all. The model must be strict enough to reject all invalid states, which is what the final, corrected FSM now does.
