"""
Provides a standardized, schema-validated logger for producing structured JSONL logs.

This module contains the `Logger` class, which is responsible for creating all
entries in the `logs/activity.log.jsonl` file. This is a critical component for
maintaining an auditable, machine-readable record of the agent's actions.

The logger enforces a strict structure on all log entries by validating them
against a formal JSON schema, which is extracted from the `LOGGING_SCHEMA.md`
document. This ensures that every log entry, regardless of its source, is
consistent and contains the required fields.

Key features of the `Logger` class:
- **Schema Validation:** Each log entry is validated against the official
  project schema before being written to disk, preventing data corruption.
- **Structured Data:** Logs are written in JSONL format, where each line is a
  valid JSON object, making them easy to parse and query.
- **Session Management:** It automatically assigns a unique `session_id` to
  all logs generated during its lifecycle, allowing actions to be traced back
  to a specific run.
- **Automatic Timestamps:** It injects a UTC timestamp into every log entry,
  providing a precise timeline of events.

This centralized logger is the sole mechanism by which the agent should record
its activities, ensuring a single source of truth for all post-mortem analysis
and self-improvement activities.
