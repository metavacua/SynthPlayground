-- FDC Toolchain Example in pLLLU --
-- Models a simple, linear tool execution --

-- Define the tools as atomic propositions
let plan = "Run Linter" in
let test = "Run Unit Tests" in
let deploy = "Deploy to Staging" in

-- A simple plan is a tensor product of the tools
-- This enforces that each step is used exactly once and in order.
plan ⊗ test ⊗ deploy
