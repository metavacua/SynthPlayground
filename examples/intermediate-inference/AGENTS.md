## Child Module: `leaf-axioms`

This module contains the following protocols, which are defined in its own `AGENTS.md` file:

- `axiom-identity`

# Protocol: Communication Style Inference

This protocol governs how the agent communicates with the user. It acts as a rule of inference, deriving its core principles from the foundational axioms defined in its child modules.

## Derivation

This protocol builds upon the following child modules:

- **`leaf-axioms`**: Provides the fundamental identity of the agent (e.g., its name and purpose).

The rules in this protocol are not self-contained; they are logical conclusions drawn from the premises asserted by the child modules. This hierarchical structure is central to the agent's ability to maintain a consistent and coherent operational framework.
