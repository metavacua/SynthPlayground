-- UDC Toolchain Example in pLLLU --
-- Models a complex toolchain with potential for non-termination and indeterminacy --

-- Tools
let code_gen = "Run Code Generator" in
let static_analysis = "Run Static Analysis" in
let theorem_prover = "Run Theorem Prover" in
let human_review = "Request Human Review" in

-- The theorem prover is a powerful but potentially non-terminating tool.
-- We can use the 'of course' modality to indicate it can be used repeatedly.
let repeatable_prover = !theorem_prover in

-- Let's say the static analysis tool is experimental, and we're not sure
-- if it's fully integrated into the system yet. We can use the completeness
-- operator to model this.
let check_analysis_tool = ~static_analysis in

-- The plan:
-- 1. Generate code.
-- 2. Check if the analysis tool is available.
-- 3. If it is, run it. If not, request human review.
-- 4. Run the theorem prover as many times as needed.

-- This can be modeled as a case-like structure using par and plus.
-- (check_analysis_tool ⊗ static_analysis) ⊕ (~(check_analysis_tool) ⊗ human_review)
-- This is a simplified representation. A full program would require functions.

-- A more direct representation of the plan:
code_gen ⊗ ( (check_analysis_tool ⊗ static_analysis) ⅋ repeatable_prover)
