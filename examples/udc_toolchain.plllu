-- UDC Toolchain Example in pLLLU --
-- Models a complex toolchain with potential for non-termination and indeterminacy --

-- The theorem prover is a powerful but potentially non-terminating tool,
-- modeled as a reusable resource with '!'.
-- The static analysis tool is experimental, so we check its readiness
-- with the completeness operator '~'.
