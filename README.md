# AI Agent Self-Improving Codebase

## Overview

This repository is an experimental environment for a self-correcting and self-improving AI agent. The agent's primary goal is to autonomously manage, refactor, and enhance its own codebase and governing protocols.

## Getting Started

All instructions for setting up the development environment, running tests, and interacting with the agent are located in the `AGENTS.md` file.

### Executable Instructions

The `AGENTS.md` file is not just documentation; it is an executable script. It contains all the necessary commands to build, test, and maintain this repository. To get started, you can run it directly:

```bash
python3 AGENTS.md
```

This will execute the commands defined within the file, ensuring that you are always following the most up-to-date procedures.

## How It Works

The core of this project is the `AGENTS.md` file, which serves as a "constructive witness." It provides a single, verifiable source of truth for how the agent should operate. The agent itself is expected to read, understand, and execute the instructions within this file.

The long-term vision is for the agent to be able to modify its own `AGENTS.md`, allowing it to evolve its own development processes and capabilities over time.
