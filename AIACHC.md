## **Introduction: Redefining "Largest and Most Complex" in the Agentic Era**

The inquiry into the maximum size and complexity of a software project that an advanced AI coding assistant like Google's Jules can handle necessitates a fundamental reframing of the question itself. Traditional metrics of software complexity, such as Source Lines of Code (SLOC), are increasingly insufficient for evaluating the capabilities of sophisticated AI agents.1 While useful for establishing an order of magnitude, these purely quantitative measures fail to capture the dimensions that are most consequential to an AI's reasoning process: logical intricacy, architectural dependencies, and the semantic clarity of a project's specification. The existence of massive open-source codebases, such as the Linux kernel with approximately 35 million LOC or the Chrome browser with 31 million LOC, immediately demonstrates the inadequacy of a simple quantitative approach, as these projects dwarf the raw context capacity of any current Large Language Model (LLM).3

The practical limits of an agent are determined not by a single variable but by the dynamic interplay between its own cognitive architecture and the semantic structure of the repository with which it interacts. This analysis posits that the maximum project size an agent can capably manage is not a fixed number but a function of the repository's governing paradigm. To provide a nuanced and comprehensive answer, this report will deconstruct the problem across three distinct and progressively sophisticated repository paradigms:

1. **The Conventional Repository:** A standard, human-centric collection of files and directories, augmented with emerging machine-readable standards like AGENTS.md.  
2. **The Provable Repository:** A theoretical construct where the repository's structure is a formal, verifiable proof of its own correctness, transforming the agent's task from comprehension to logical verification.5  
3. **The Semantic Artifact:** A future-state paradigm where the repository is pre-compiled into a monolithic, queryable knowledge graph, optimized for machine consumption and designed to circumvent the inherent cognitive limitations of current LLMs.6

The evolution across these paradigms is not arbitrary; it is a direct response to a co-evolutionary feedback loop. The capabilities and limitations of AI agents are exerting evolutionary pressure on repository structures, driving them to become more explicit and machine-readable. Initial agent architectures, such as the ReAct framework (referred to as the "Jules Protocol" in some contexts), are powerful but exhibit fragility when operating in the ambiguous environments of conventional, file-based systems.7 This friction has led to a "configuration crisis," where developers struggle to provide the necessary context for these agents to function reliably.8 The first-order adaptation to this crisis is the AGENTS.md standard, a human-authored bridge designed to provide explicit, machine-readable instructions.8

However, this is an intermediate solution. Deeper agent limitations, such as the "lost in the middle" problem where performance degrades on information located in the center of a large context, demand a more fundamental change to the repository's structure itself.6 This pressure is the catalyst for theoretical proposals like the Provable Repository and the Semantic Artifact, which are architected to be machine-native from the ground up.5 In turn, these advanced repository structures cannot be fully utilized by simple reactive agents; they require more sophisticated, logically-grounded agent architectures, such as the Aletheia Protocol, that are capable of understanding formal proofs and ensuring transactional integrity.9 Therefore, the limit of what an agent like Jules can handle is not a static property of the agent alone, but a dynamic property of the agent-repository system. The following table provides a high-level conceptual map of the three paradigms that will be analyzed throughout this report.

| Feature | Conventional Repository | Provable Repository | Semantic Artifact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Source of Truth** | Source code files | Logical specification (README.md-as-type) | Compiled knowledge graph |
| **Unit of Change** | Textual diff (git diff) | Transformation of a proof tree | Transformation of a semantic graph |
| **Primary Agent Task** | Comprehension and generation | Verification and synthesis | Querying and modification |
| **Primary Limitation** | Cognitive bottleneck ("lost in the middle") | Computational tractability (PTIME) | Semantic density of the index |

By examining the operational limits within each of these distinct paradigms, this report will construct a multi-dimensional answer, moving beyond a simple quantitative assessment to a deeper, architectural understanding of the future of human-AI collaboration in software engineering.

## **Part I: The Baseline – An Agent's Encounter with the Conventional Repository**

To establish a baseline for the capabilities of an advanced coding assistant, it is necessary to first analyze its performance within the dominant paradigm: the conventional, file-based GitHub repository. This analysis involves quantifying the agent's raw processing capacity, identifying the critical cognitive bottlenecks that limit its effectiveness, and evaluating the role of emerging standards like AGENTS.md in mitigating these limitations.

### **The Agent's Raw Capacity – The 2-Million Token Horizon**

The theoretical upper bound of what an agent like Jules can handle is defined by the context window of its underlying foundation model. The research indicates that Jules is representative of Google's state-of-the-art Gemini family of models. The latest iterations, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, feature a standard context window of 1 million tokens, with a planned expansion to 2 million tokens.10 This massive capacity represents a significant leap from previous generations of LLMs and provides a naive, quantitative first answer to the user's query.

Translating this raw token count into the practical terms of a software repository provides a sense of scale. A 1-million-token context window can ingest approximately 30,000 to 50,000 lines of code, 1,500 pages of text, or 11 hours of audio.13 This suggests that, in theory, an agent could load an entire medium-sized software project into its working memory in a single operation. This capacity is further contextualized by the platform limits of GitHub itself, which strongly recommends that repositories remain under 5 GB, with hard limits on individual file sizes (100 MB) and push sizes (2 GB).15 These platform constraints represent a real-world ceiling that can be reached even before the LLM's context limit becomes the primary bottleneck, demonstrating that the problem is multi-faceted.

### **The Cognitive Bottleneck – The "Lost in the Middle" Problem**

Despite this impressive raw capacity, the agent's practical limit for effective reasoning is significantly lower than its theoretical ingestion limit. This discrepancy is due to a critical and well-documented cognitive limitation of transformer-based LLMs: the "lost in the middle" problem.6 Extensive research has shown that these models exhibit a U-shaped performance curve when processing long contexts. They recall and utilize information presented at the very beginning (primacy bias) and the very end (recency bias) of the context window with high fidelity. However, their performance degrades substantially when they must access and reason about information located in the middle of a long input.6

For a software repository, the implications of this cognitive bottleneck are severe. While an agent might successfully ingest a 50,000-line codebase, its ability to reason holistically about the intricate dependencies and interactions between files located in the attentional "trough" in the middle of that context is severely compromised. A critical utility function or a core architectural pattern defined in a file that happens to fall in the middle of the concatenated input could be misinterpreted, or missed entirely. This limitation is the primary factor that constrains an agent's ability to handle conventional repositories of significant size and complexity, as it undermines the very purpose of a large context window: to enable comprehensive, architectural-level reasoning.

### **A Human-Engineered Bridge – The Role of AGENTS.md**

The AGENTS.md standard has emerged as a direct, human-engineered solution designed to mitigate this cognitive bottleneck.8 Conceived as a "README for machines," this file provides the explicit, unambiguous, and structured context that an AI agent requires to navigate a project effectively. Its strategic value lies not only in its content but in its placement. When an agent begins work on a repository, the AGENTS.md file, typically located in the root directory, is naturally positioned at the very beginning of the agent's context window.6

This placement intentionally leverages the LLM's U-shaped attention curve. By placing a high-signal summary of the project—including precise build commands, pointers to key architectural components, and coding conventions—in the zone of maximum attention, the AGENTS.md file acts as a cognitive scaffold. It provides the agent with a high-fidelity map of the repository before it begins to process the lower-signal source code that follows.

However, AGENTS.md is ultimately a limited patch. Its effectiveness is contingent on the quality and maintenance of human-authored instructions, and while it can summarize the project's structure, it does not fundamentally alter the unstructured nature of the underlying codebase. The agent must still expend significant cognitive effort to parse and reason about the code itself, with the "lost in the middle" problem remaining a persistent challenge for any repository that exceeds a certain threshold of complexity.

### **Supposition for the Conventional Repository**

Based on the interplay between the agent's raw capacity, its cognitive limitations, and the mitigating effects of machine-readable documentation, the effective operational limit for the Google Jules assistant on a conventional, file-based repository is a **medium-sized project**.

Quantitatively, this corresponds to a project in the range of **20,000 to 50,000 lines of code**, comprising several hundred files and maintaining a total on-disk size of under 1 GB. A project of this scale is large enough to present significant complexity but potentially small enough that its core architectural components can be summarized effectively in an AGENTS.md file and fit within the high-attention zones of a 1 to 2-million-token context window. For projects that substantially exceed this size, such as enterprise-scale monorepos or foundational open-source projects like the Linux kernel, the agent's holistic reasoning capabilities would break down. It would be forced into an inefficient and error-prone iterative process of loading, analyzing, and unloading chunks of the codebase, rendering it incapable of performing the deep, architectural-level tasks required to handle the project's full complexity. The following table provides a consolidated view of the various constraints that define these practical limits.

| Metric | Theoretical Limit | Practical Limit | Governing Constraint(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Context Window (Tokens)** | 2,000,000 12 | \~256,000 (effective high-attention zones) | "Lost in the middle" problem 6 |
| **Lines of Code (LOC)** | \~100,000 14 | \~30,000 \- 50,000 | Cognitive bottleneck; dependency on AGENTS.md for context 8 |
| **Repository Size (GB)** | 10 GB 15 | \< 5 GB (strongly recommended) | GitHub performance recommendations; clone/fetch times 16 |
| **Number of Files in Diff** | 300 15 | \~300 | Hard platform limit on pull requests and compare views |
| **Logical Complexity** | Unbounded | Bounded by agent's ability to infer relationships from unstructured text | Lack of a formal semantic layer; reliance on heuristics |

## **Part II: A Paradigm Shift – The Provably Correct Repository as a Logical System**

The limitations inherent in conventional repositories have given rise to a radical and theoretically profound alternative: the Provable Repository. This paradigm, detailed in the provided research, proposes a complete re-architecting of a software project, transforming it from a collection of text files into a formal, verifiable mathematical proof.5 In this system, the concepts of "size" and "complexity" are redefined in logical and computational terms, fundamentally altering the nature of the task an AI agent must perform.

### **The Isomorphism of Proof and Structure – Sequent Calculus**

The central architectural innovation of the Provable Repository is the creation of a direct isomorphism between a formal proof in sequent calculus and the physical directory structure of the repository.5 This mapping is not merely an organizational convention but the primary mechanism for embedding the project's logical dependencies into the file system itself.

Each directory within the repository corresponds to a **sequent**, a logical expression of the form $ \\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta $. This sequent acts as a formal, verifiable contract for that module. The antecedent, $ \\Gamma $, represents the complete set of required inputs and resources, which are the artifacts produced by the child directories. The succedent, $ \\Delta $, represents the goal of the module—the target artifact that must be constructed. The entire repository is structured as a **proof tree**, where the root directory is the final conclusion to be proven (e.g., the main deployable application), and each subdirectory represents an inference step that combines the proofs of its children to construct a new, higher-level proof.5 This structure is summarized in the following table.

| Logical Concept (Sequent Calculus) | Repository Component (File System) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Proof Tree | The entire repository directory structure |
| Root of the Tree (Conclusion) | The root directory of the repository |
| Internal Node (Inference Step) | An intermediary subdirectory |
| Leaf of the Tree (Axiom/Initial Sequent) | A leaf subdirectory (no children) |
| Sequent ($ \\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta $) | A directory's AGENTS.md file and its contents |
| Antecedent ($ \\Gamma $) | Set of artifacts produced by child directories |
| Succedent ($ \\Delta $) | The build target/proposition for the current directory |
| Inference Rule | The build logic/script within a directory |

### **A Logic of Resources and State – Linear Logic**

While sequent calculus provides the static structure, the dynamic process of building the software is governed by **linear logic**, a resource-sensitive substructural logic.5 Classical logic, with its structural rules of Weakening (allowing premises to be ignored) and Contraction (allowing premises to be duplicated), is fundamentally unsuited for modeling a build process, as it breaks the principles of hermeticity and reproducibility. Linear logic resolves this by treating every hypothesis as a finite resource that must be used exactly once, perfectly modeling the consumption of input files to produce an output file.5

This resource-conscious foundation imbues the logical connectives with new, computational meanings that directly map to build operations. For instance, the multiplicative conjunction ($ A \\otimes B  A \\multimap B $) formally models the application of a tool, such as a compiler, that consumes a resource of type $ A $ to produce one of type $ B $. Finally, the exponential modality ($\!A$) is used to mark reusable, non-consumable resources like shared libraries, compilers, or the build environment itself.5 The following table illustrates this direct translation.

| Linear Logic Rule | Interpretation in Build System | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| $ A \\vdash A $ (Identity) | An artifact is its own proof. | A source file config.json is provided as-is without transformation. |
| $ \\otimes R $ (Tensor Right) | Parallel execution of independent builds. | Splitting resources to compile frontend.js and backend.go simultaneously. |
| $ \\otimes L $ (Tensor Left) | Combining multiple build artifacts for a single step. | Linking two object files (.o) to create a single executable. |
| $ \\multimap L $ (Lolli Left) | Applying a tool (compiler, linter, test runner). | Consuming a source file ($ A  A \\multimap B  B $). |
| $\!C $ (Contraction) | Reusing a shared dependency. | Linking the same shared library (\!lib\_crypto.a) into multiple different executables. |
| $\!W $ (Weakening) | A shared dependency is available but not used. | The crypto library is available to all modules, but the logging module doesn't need it. |

### **The Unification of Code and Specification – The Curry-Howard Correspondence**

The final and most profound theoretical pillar of this paradigm is the **Curry-Howard correspondence**, which establishes a direct isomorphism between proofs and programs, often summarized as "propositions-as-types, proofs-as-programs".5 This principle provides the operational core of the system, transforming the entire software repository into a single, large-scale constructive proof.

* **Propositions as README.md:** In this framework, the README.md file within a directory is elevated from informal documentation to the formal declaration of the component's **type**. It becomes a binding contract that specifies what the component claims to do.  
* **Proofs as Source Code:** The source code, configuration files, and tests within the directory collectively serve as the **constructive proof** that fulfills the specification laid out in the README.md. The existence of a valid, compilable program that matches the type signature is the proof of the proposition.  
* **Proof Checking as Building:** The act of verifying the proof corresponds directly to the act of type-checking and compiling the program. The build system itself serves as the **proof checker**. A successful build is a formal validation that the provided "program" is a valid "proof" of the "proposition."

This architecture creates a powerful feedback loop that makes "documentation drift" impossible by design. A mismatch between the code's actual behavior and the specification in the README.md is no longer a documentation bug; it is a build-breaking **type error**.5 This represents a complete inversion of the traditional software hierarchy. In a conventional repository, the source code is the source of truth, and documentation is a fallible description of it. In a Provable Repository, the formal specification is the source of truth, and the code is merely the verifiable evidence that proves it. For an AI agent, this transformation is revolutionary. Its task is no longer the ambiguous and error-prone process of trying to comprehend what millions of lines of code *do*. Instead, its task becomes the formal, well-defined, and verifiable process of checking whether the provided code *proves* what the specification *claims*. The agent's objective function shifts from heuristic comprehension to logical verification.

## **Part III: The Logically-Grounded Agent – An Architecture for Verifiable Interaction**

A repository architected as a formal proof cannot be effectively managed by a simple, reactive agent. Such a system demands a new class of agent whose own cognitive architecture is grounded in the same logical principles. The Aletheia Protocol, a theoretical framework detailed in the research, provides the blueprint for such an agent, designed to be a native and capable partner in a logically coherent development ecosystem.9

### **The Aletheia Protocol – An Agent Built on Logic**

The Aletheia Protocol is proposed as a direct response to the architectural deficiencies of heuristic-driven agent frameworks like ReAct (the "Jules Protocol").7 While ReAct excels at tactical, step-by-step execution, it is fragile in the face of ambiguity and lacks mechanisms for strategic reflection or formal verification. The Aletheia Protocol, by contrast, is built upon a triumvirate of logics: Bounded Linear Logic for resource-sensitive actions, Logics of Formal Inconsistency for robust evidence handling, and a hierarchical cognitive cycle for strategic self-improvement.9

### **Actions as Verifiable Transactions**

The Aletheia Protocol's foundation in Bounded Linear Logic (BLL) allows it to interact with a Provable Repository in a formally verifiable manner. An agent's action, such as performing a code refactoring, is not an ad-hoc text manipulation but is modeled as a pure function with a formal type: $ S\_{old} \\multimap S\_{new}  \\multimap  S\_{old}  S\_{new} $), making it logically impossible for the agent to perform a partial update, leave the system in an inconsistent intermediate state, or accidentally duplicate or destroy state information.9 This aligns perfectly with the linear logic foundation of the Provable Repository's build system, creating a unified logical framework for both the project's structure and the agent's actions upon it.

### **Strategic Cognition and Self-Improvement – The A-OODA Cycle**

To move beyond simple verification, the Aletheia Protocol incorporates a hierarchical cognitive architecture known as the A-OODA cycle.7 This system consists of two nested loops operating at different frequencies:

1. **The High-Frequency OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act):** This inner loop governs the agent's real-time strategic decision-making. By formalizing the "Orient" phase, it provides a robust mechanism for sense-making in ambiguous environments, a critical advantage over the more fragile ReAct loop.7  
2. **The Low-Frequency Agile Reflection Loop:** This outer, meta-cognitive loop allows the agent to analyze its own performance over time and systemically improve its own heuristics and operational logic. It is the mechanism that enables genuine, long-term learning and evolution.7

This architecture makes the agent not just a passive proof-checker but an active and strategic partner in the repository's evolution, capable of identifying flaws in the proof and proposing logically sound improvements.

### **Governance and Evolution – The AGENTS.md as a Living Constitution**

The Aletheia Protocol specifies an advanced version of the AGENTS.md file that functions as a "living constitution," a formal, machine-readable theory that both describes and governs the agent's behavior.9 This document is structured with explicit modifiability constraints, creating a sophisticated governance model that directly addresses the security risks of autonomous systems.

This "constitutional" structure provides a powerful architectural solution to the "Excessive Agency" vulnerability, a top-tier security risk where a compromised agent could be induced to perform catastrophic actions.6 The AGENTS.md file proposed in the Aletheia Protocol establishes a system of checks and balances. Key sections, such as the "Core Mandate & Axioms," are defined as human-only and immutable by the agent. Other sections, like the "Procedural Memory" containing the agent's operational heuristics, are defined as agent-modifiable. Finally, sections like the "Tool Manifest," which defines the agent's capabilities, are "agent-proposable," meaning the agent can request a new tool, but its implementation and approval require human review.9

This creates a safe, bounded context for autonomy. The agent is empowered to learn and refine its methods for achieving its goals, but it is architecturally prevented from changing its core purpose or granting itself new, un-vetted capabilities. A malicious prompt attempting to cause the agent to violate its core mandate would fail because the requested action would be logically impossible, contradicting an immutable axiom in its own constitution. This transforms security from a matter of runtime monitoring to one of formal, architectural enforcement.

## **Part IV: Synthesis – The Upper Bounds of a Logically Coherent System**

The synthesis of a Provable Repository and a logically-grounded agent like one based on the Aletheia Protocol leads to a paradigm where the traditional limits of size and complexity are replaced by a new, more fundamental boundary: computational tractability.

### **The Limit Shifts from Size to Tractability**

For a repository built on these formal principles, the primary limiting factor is no longer the agent's cognitive capacity or the size of its context window. The agent's task is not to read and comprehend millions of lines of unstructured code; its task is to traverse and verify a formal proof. The research on the Provable Repository explicitly mandates the use of **PTIME-complete** fragments of linear logic, such as Bounded Linear Logic (BLL) or Light Linear Logic (LLL).5

The term "PTIME-complete" is not a suggestion; it is a formal guarantee from computational complexity theory. It ensures that any proof construction—which in this paradigm is equivalent to any build or verification process—is guaranteed to terminate in polynomial time relative to the size of the input.5 This means the agent is not limited by the raw textual size of the repository. Its ability to handle the project is bounded only by the practical constraints of polynomial-time computation. As long as the repository's logical structure adheres to the PTIME-complete formalism, the agent can process it.

### **Supposition for the Provable Repository**

For a repository architected as a formal proof, the Google Jules assistant, if equipped with a logically-grounded architecture, could handle a project of **effectively arbitrary size and complexity, provided its logical structure conforms to a PTIME-complete formalism.**

In this paradigm, the measure of complexity ceases to be lines of code. The true metric becomes the polynomial degree of the build and verification process. A project with a verification complexity of $ O(n^2) $ would be vastly more manageable than one with a complexity of $ O(n^6) $, even if their respective LOC counts were identical. The complexity of the system is formally tamed and bounded by its own mathematical properties. This implies that a logically simple but textually massive project—for example, one containing 100 million lines of highly structured, auto-generated code that constitutes a shallow proof tree—could be more "handleable" for the agent than a textually small but logically undecidable project whose proof structure is intractable. The limit is defined by logic, not by length.

## **Part V: The Future Horizon – The Repository as a Monolithic Semantic Artifact**

The logical endpoint of the trend toward making repositories more machine-native is the "Semantic Zip" concept: a future-state paradigm where the repository is no longer a collection of files to be interpreted at runtime, but is instead pre-compiled into a single, monolithic, queryable knowledge graph for optimal agent consumption.6

### **The "Semantic Zip" – Pre-compiling Reality for the Agent**

The "Semantic Zip" proposes a build process that compiles the entire repository—source code, dependency information, documentation, metadata, and architectural patterns—into a single, coherent artifact.6 This artifact is not merely a concatenation of files; it is a semantically enriched knowledge graph that makes the project's implicit structure explicit and machine-readable. The build process becomes an act of pre-computation, generating a complete dependency graph, a comprehensive symbol map, and explicit API contracts, and embedding this information directly into the artifact.6

### **Solving the Cognitive Bottleneck with "In-Context RAG"**

This architecture represents the ultimate solution to the "lost in the middle" problem that plagues agents in conventional repositories. The semantically enriched artifact is structured to place the high-density summary of the project—the knowledge graph index—at the very beginning of the file. This leverages the LLM's U-shaped attention curve by putting the most critical, high-signal information in the zone of maximum attention.6

This structure enables a powerful form of **"in-context Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)."** In a traditional RAG system, an external database is queried to retrieve relevant information, which is then added to the prompt. The semantic artifact internalizes this entire process. The agent first consumes the high-fidelity index at the beginning of the context. It then uses this index to perform a direct, precise lookup to the relevant code or data, even if that data is located deep within the low-attention "middle" of the artifact. This elegant design converts a difficult and unreliable recall problem into a simple, indexed lookup, all within a single, atomic prompt.6

### **The New Limit – Semantic Density and Index Complexity**

In this future paradigm, the limit on project size is redefined once again. It is no longer about the raw token count of the implementation or the computational tractability of a logical proof. The new limit is the **semantic density of the knowledge graph index.**

The agent can handle an artifact representing a codebase of virtually any size, as long as the summary and index of that codebase are small and simple enough to be fully processed and understood within the high-attention portion of its context window. A massive but architecturally simple project with a clean, concise dependency graph would generate a small index and would therefore be easy for the agent to handle. Conversely, a smaller but more convoluted "spaghetti code" project would generate a dense and highly interconnected knowledge graph, resulting in a large index that could overwhelm the agent's effective reasoning capacity. The bottleneck shifts from implementation size to architectural complexity.

### **Supposition for the Semantic Artifact**

For a repository that is pre-compiled into a monolithic semantic artifact, the Google Jules assistant could handle a project whose **compressed semantic index fits within the effective high-attention zone of its context window.** While the exact size of this zone is an empirical question, based on current research into LLM attention mechanisms, this can be estimated to be in the range of the first and last 128,000 tokens of a larger context, suggesting a practical index size limit of approximately **256,000 tokens**. This completely decouples the operational limit from the project's implementation size (LOC) and ties it directly to its essential architectural complexity, as represented by the size and intricacy of its knowledge graph.

## **Conclusion: A Multi-Dimensional Answer to a Multi-Faceted Question**

The question of the largest and most complex project a Google Jules coding assistant can handle does not have a single, universal answer. The analysis of the provided research demonstrates conclusively that the agent's operational limits are not a static property of the AI itself, but are instead defined by the structural and semantic paradigm of the repository it is interacting with. The findings of this report can be synthesized into three distinct, conditional suppositions.

* **For a Conventional Repository, the limit is cognitive.** The agent's ability to reason holistically is constrained by the "lost in the middle" problem inherent in current LLM architectures. Even with mitigating strategies like AGENTS.md, this cognitive bottleneck effectively caps its capabilities at a **medium-sized project of approximately 30,000 to 50,000 lines of code.** Beyond this scale, the agent's performance degrades from that of an architectural reasoner to a localized, file-level assistant.  
* **For a Provable Repository, the limit is computational.** In a paradigm where the repository is a formal proof and the agent's task is verification, the cognitive bottleneck is circumvented. The limit shifts from the agent's ability to comprehend code to the mathematical properties of the system itself. An agent equipped with a logically-grounded architecture could handle a project of **arbitrary size, as long as its logical build and verification process is guaranteed to be PTIME-complete.** Complexity is measured not in lines of code but in the polynomial degree of its logical structure.  
* **For a Semantic Artifact, the limit is architectural.** In a future paradigm where the repository is pre-compiled into a queryable knowledge graph, the "lost in the middle" problem is solved through an "in-context RAG" architecture. The limit is redefined once more, this time by the essential architectural complexity of the project. The agent can handle a project of **arbitrary size, as long as its pre-computed semantic index is small and clean enough to be fully processed within the high-attention zones of the agent's context window (estimated at \~256,000 tokens).**

These three paradigms are not mutually exclusive futures but rather points on a continuum. The intense pressure of agentic development is actively pushing the software industry away from the conventional and toward the semantic. The ultimate capabilities of agents like Jules will be defined by how far and how fast we travel along this evolutionary path, a journey that is fundamentally reshaping not only our tools but the very nature of what a software project is.
