# Knowledge Graph Analysis Report

## Summary

This report details the findings of an analysis to determine the number of distinct knowledge graphs or semantic webs within this repository.

## Findings

After a thorough analysis of the repository, I have identified **two primary knowledge sources** that are merged to form a single, comprehensive knowledge graph.

These sources are:

1.  **Protocol Knowledge Graph**:
    *   **`knowledge_core/protocols.ttl`**: This file defines the base ontology and the core concepts of the agent's protocols and rules.
    *   **`knowledge_core/enriched_protocols.ttl`**: This file is the output of a process that extends the base protocol graph by linking its entities to the external DBpedia knowledge graph.

2.  **Filesystem Knowledge Graph**:
    *   **`knowledge_core/filesystem_ontology.ttl`**: This file defines the ontology for representing the file system structure, with classes for `Directory` and `File`.
    *   **`knowledge_core/filesystem_data.ttl`**: This file contains the RDF data generated by scanning the repository's directory structure.

These two knowledge sources are programmatically merged to create a single, richer knowledge graph that provides a semantic representation of both the agent's protocols and the repository's structure.

Other files, such as `dependency_graph.json`, were identified as graph-like structures but were determined to be dependency graphs rather than knowledge graphs.

## Conclusion

The repository contains a single, comprehensive knowledge graph that is created by merging two distinct knowledge sources: one describing the agent's protocols and another describing the repository's filesystem structure. This combined graph is a central component of the agent's knowledge and reasoning capabilities.
