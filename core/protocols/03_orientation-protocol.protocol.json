  "description": "Defines the mandatory, four-tiered orientation cascade that must be executed at the start of any task to establish a coherent model of the agent's identity, environment, and the world state.\n\n**Associated Tool Documentation (`tooling/environmental_probe.py`):**\n\n  \n  ### `/app/tooling/environmental_probe.py`\n  Performs a series of checks to assess the capabilities of the execution environment.\n  \n  This script is a critical diagnostic tool run at the beginning of a task to\n  ensure the agent understands its operational sandbox. It verifies fundamental\n  capabilities required for most software development tasks:\n  \n  1.  **Filesystem I/O:** Confirms that the agent can create, write to, read from,\n      and delete files. It also provides a basic latency measurement for these\n      operations.\n  2.  **Network Connectivity:** Checks for external network access by attempting to\n      connect to a highly-available public endpoint (google.com). This is crucial\n      for tasks requiring `git` operations, package downloads, or API calls.\n  3.  **Environment Variables:** Verifies that standard environment variables are\n      accessible, which is a prerequisite for many command-line tools.\n  \n  The script generates a human-readable report summarizing the results of these\n  probes, allowing the agent to quickly identify any environmental constraints\n  that might impact its ability to complete a task.\n  \n  **Public Functions:**\n  \n  - #### `def main()`\n    > Runs all environmental probes and prints a summary report.\n  \n  - #### `def probe_environment_variables()`\n    > Checks for the presence of a common environment variable.\n  \n  - #### `def probe_filesystem()`\n    > Tests file system write/read/delete capabilities and measures latency.\n  \n  - #### `def probe_network()`\n    > Tests network connectivity and measures latency to a reliable external endpoint.\n",
