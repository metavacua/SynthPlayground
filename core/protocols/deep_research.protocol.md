# Protocol: Deep Research Cycle

This protocol defines a standardized, multi-step plan for conducting in-depth research on a complex topic. It is designed to be a reusable, callable plan that ensures a systematic and thorough investigation.

The cycle consists of five main phases:
1.  **Review Scanned Documents:** The agent first reviews the content of documents found in the repository during the initial scan. This provides immediate, project-specific context.
2.  **Initial Scoping & Keyword Generation:** Based on the initial topic and the information from scanned documents, the agent generates a set of search keywords.
3.  **Broad Information Gathering:** The agent uses the keywords to perform broad web searches and collect a list of relevant URLs.
4.  **Targeted Information Extraction:** The agent visits the most promising URLs to extract detailed information.
5.  **Synthesis & Summary:** The agent synthesizes the gathered information into a coherent summary, which is saved to a research report file.

This structured approach ensures that research is not ad-hoc but is instead a repeatable and verifiable process.
