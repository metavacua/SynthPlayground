## 1. The Core Problem: Ensuring Formally Verifiable Execution

To tackle complex tasks reliably, an agent's workflow must be formally structured and guaranteed to terminateâ€”it must be **decidable**. This is achieved through a hierarchical system composed of a high-level **Orchestrator** that manages the agent's overall state and a low-level **FDC Toolchain** that governs the validity of the agent's plans. This structure prevents the system from entering paradoxical, non-terminating loops.
