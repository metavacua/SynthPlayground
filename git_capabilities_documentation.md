# Git Environment Capabilities and Limitations

## Introduction

This document outlines the capabilities and limitations of the git environment in which I operate. The findings are based on a series of experiments conducted to understand the available git functionalities. The goal of this document is to serve as a guide for my future actions and to prevent errors caused by incorrect assumptions about the environment.

## Summary of Findings

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Local Branch Creation | Yes | I can create, switch between, and delete local branches using standard git commands. |
| Staging and Committing | No | I cannot use `git commit` to create commits. The environment frequently enters a "detached HEAD" state, and commits do not persist on branches. |
| Branch Merging | No | As I cannot create commits on different branches, I am unable to perform merges. |
| Remote Management | Partially | I can add and remove remote repositories using `git remote`. |
| Pushing to Remotes | No | Direct pushes to remotes are not supported. |
| Proposing Changes | Yes | The `submit` tool is the designated method for proposing changes. It is analogous to creating a pull request. |

## Detailed Findings

### Local Branch Manipulation

I have full capabilities for local branch manipulation. I can successfully:

*   Create a new branch with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
*   Switch between branches with `git checkout <branch-name>`.
*   Delete a branch with `git branch -d <branch-name>`.

### Staging and Committing

My experiments have shown that I cannot use `git commit` to create commits in a persistent way. When I attempt to commit, the environment often enters a "detached HEAD" state, and the commit is not associated with the current branch. This indicates that the standard git workflow of staging and committing changes is not supported.

**Conclusion:** I must not rely on `git commit` to save my work. The `submit` tool is the correct and only way to propose changes.

### Branch Merging

Given the inability to create commits on different branches, it is impossible to perform a `git merge`. Any workflow that relies on merging branches is not feasible in this environment.

**Conclusion:** I must avoid any actions that require merging branches. I should structure my work to be linear and self-contained within a single set of changes.

### Remote Interactions

I can add and remove remote repositories using `git remote add` and `git remote remove`. However, since I cannot create commits, I cannot use `git push` to send changes to a remote repository.

**Conclusion:** While I can manage remote configurations, the `submit` tool is the only way to interact with the `origin` remote to propose changes. I should not attempt to push changes manually.

## Implications for Future Work

Based on these findings, I will adopt the following principles in my future work:

*   **Single Set of Changes:** I will treat each task as a single set of changes that will be submitted at the end. I will not attempt to create complex commit histories or manage multiple feature branches.
*   **Use of the `submit` Tool:** I will use the `submit` tool exclusively for proposing changes. I will not attempt to use `git commit` or `git push`.
*   **Linear Development:** I will work in a linear fashion, making changes and then submitting them. I will not attempt to perform merges or other complex git operations.
*   **Local Branches for Organization:** I can still use local branches to organize my work in progress, but I will not attempt to commit to them.

By adhering to these principles, I can work more effectively and avoid the errors that arise from incorrect assumptions about the git environment.
