# Context-Sensitive Language Witnesses

This directory contains witness grammars for the **Context-Sensitive Languages (CSL)** class.

## The Central Witness (`an_bn_cn.txt`)

The file `an_bn_cn.txt` contains a standard context-sensitive grammar for the language `L = {a^n b^n c^n | n >= 1}`. This language is a canonical example of a CSL that is not context-free. The grammar uses rules of the form `αAβ → αγβ`, where the replacement of a non-terminal depends on its surrounding context.

## Researching "Left" and "Right" Context-Sensitive Grammars

The terms "Left-Context-Sensitive" and "Right-Context-Sensitive" do not appear to be standard in formal language theory literature. A search for these exact terms yields no direct definitions.

However, research into the structure of CSG production rules provides a strong hypothesis for their meaning, based on equivalent grammar formalisms:

1.  **Non-Contracting Grammars:** A key property of CSLs is that they can be generated by non-contracting grammars, where for every rule `u -> v`, the length of `v` is at least the length of `u`.
2.  **Kuroda Normal Form (KNF):** Any non-contracting grammar can be converted into an equivalent grammar in Kuroda Normal Form. KNF rules are restricted to four simple types:
    *   `AB -> CD`
    *   `A -> BC`
    *   `A -> B`
    *   `A -> a`

**Hypothesis:**
The "Left" and "Right" distinction in the diagram likely refers to a restriction on one of these simplified forms, most plausibly a restriction on which side the "context" can appear in a rule.

For example, a **Left-Context-Sensitive Grammar** might be one where rules are restricted to the form `AB -> CB`, where `A` acts as the left-context for the transformation of `B`. Conversely, a **Right-Context-Sensitive Grammar** might restrict rules to the form `AB -> AC`, where `B` is the right-context for `A`.

This interpretation aligns with the diagram's theme of exploring structural variations within a language class. The witness grammars in this directory will be constructed based on this working hypothesis.
