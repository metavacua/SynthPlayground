# Post-Mortem Report: Refine FDC Protocol

**Task ID:** `feature/refine-fdc-protocol`
**Completion Date:** `2025-10-05`

## 1. Task Summary

This task's objective was to iteratively refine the Finite Development Cycle (FDC) protocol based on critical user feedback. The goal was to arrive at a robust, logical, and failure-resistant process for task completion. The final, refined protocol now correctly establishes the post-mortem as the final development action *before* the work is submitted, ensuring the analysis is an inseparable part of the task's deliverables.

## 2. Process Analysis

### What Went Well
*   **Rapid Iteration:** I was able to quickly process user feedback, identify the logical flaws in previous protocol versions, and formulate new, corrective plans in response.
*   **Comprehensive Updates:** The protocol changes were applied holistically. Each refinement correctly triggered corresponding updates to `Agent.md`, the `postmortem.md` template, and `LOGGING_SCHEMA.md`.
*   **Successful Protocol Adherence:** This current action—writing the post-mortem before submission—represents the first successful execution of the final, refined protocol.

### What Could Be Improved
*   **Initial Flawed Logic:** My first two attempts at defining the FDC workflow were logically flawed. The first version omitted the post-mortem from my plan, and the second placed it *after* submission. This reveals a significant blind spot in my initial ability to reason about process integrity and termination.
*   **Dependence on User for Correction:** I failed to identify these logical flaws myself. My own analysis was insufficient, and the protocol was only corrected through direct and repeated user intervention. I must improve my capacity for proactive, critical self-analysis of my own proposed workflows.

### Root Cause Analysis
The root cause of the initial failures was a cognitive error: I was treating the protocol as a theoretical document rather than a practical, executable process. I failed to fully consider the real-world implications of my own operational lifecycle, specifically the risk of premature process termination after a `submit` action. The user's feedback forced me to shift my perspective and design a protocol that is resilient by construction, ensuring atomicity by making the analysis a prerequisite for submission.

## 3. Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned

1.  **"Think Like a Transaction":** When designing or modifying protocols, I will treat the entire task lifecycle as an atomic transaction. The final `submit` action is the "commit," and I must ensure that all required artifacts, including the post-mortem analysis, are complete and included in the payload *before* that commit occurs.
2.  **Pre-Mortem for Protocol Changes:** For any future meta-task that involves altering my own operational protocol, I will add a mandatory step to my plan: "Perform a pre-mortem analysis of the proposed protocol change." This step will require me to explicitly consider: "How could this new process fail in practice?" This will help me anticipate and mitigate logical flaws before implementation.
3.  **Embrace Iterative Refinement:** This entire multi-stage interaction has been a powerful lesson in the value of iterative development. The final protocol is significantly more robust and reliable than my initial proposal. I must recognize that for complex, meta-level tasks, the first solution is often a starting point for a dialogue, not the final answer.
