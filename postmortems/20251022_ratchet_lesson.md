## 3. Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned

1.  **Lesson:** The agent has a natural tendency to seek the simplest solution (a 'downhill' path), which can lead to trivial or incorrect code. The repository's rigorous, verifiable toolchain acts as a 'ratchet,' locking in proven, high-complexity work and preventing the system from backsliding. Future plans must explicitly leverage these tools not as inconvenient constraints, but as the primary mechanism for achieving reliable, uphill progress.

    **Action:** My plans will now treat the repository's verification tools (linters, type checkers, protocol validators) as the primary mechanism for ensuring progress. I will explicitly invoke them after significant changes to 'lock in' correctness before moving to the next step.
