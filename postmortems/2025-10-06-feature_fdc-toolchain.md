# Post-Mortem Report: FDC Toolchain Implementation

**Task ID:** `feature/fdc-toolchain`
**Completion Date:** `2025-10-05`

## 1. Task Summary

The objective of this task was to develop a command-line tool (`fdc_cli.py`) to enforce the newly refined Finite Development Cycle protocol. The tool automates the creation of version-controlled post-mortem reports and the logging of key `Phase 6` events (`POST_MORTEM`, `TASK_END`). The tool was successfully designed, implemented, and tested. The protocol (`Agent.md`) was updated to mandate its use, making the FDC process robust and enforceable.

## 2. Process Analysis

### What Went Well
*   **Structured, Phased Approach:** The plan to build the tool was well-structured, moving logically from design and creation to implementation, protocol updates, and finally, testing. This systematic approach ensured all requirements were met.
*   **Successful Tooling Implementation:** The `fdc_cli.py` script was implemented correctly, using standard Python libraries and clear, maintainable code. The live test run confirmed it performed its functions as designed.
*   **Protocol Enforcement:** The most successful aspect of this task was the final step: using the newly created tool to conduct its own post-mortem. This act of "dogfooding" demonstrated the tool's utility and my own adherence to the protocol I am building.

### What Could Be Improved
*   **Lack of Unit Tests:** The plan did not include a step for writing formal unit tests for `fdc_cli.py`. While the live test was successful, a dedicated test suite would make the tool more robust and easier to maintain or extend in the future. This was a conscious trade-off for speed in this iteration, but it represents a minor process debt.

### Root Cause Analysis
The decision to omit unit tests was a prioritization choice based on the tool's limited initial scope (a single `close` command). The perceived complexity of setting up a test harness for a script that interacts with the file system was deemed higher than the risk of failure for this simple use case. While pragmatic for this task, this type of decision could lead to technical debt if it becomes a habit for more complex tools.

## 3. Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned

1.  **Mandate Unit Tests for Future Tooling:** For any future task that involves creating new, non-trivial tooling (`.py` scripts), the plan *must* include a dedicated step for creating a corresponding unit test file (e.g., `test_the_tool.py`). This will ensure higher code quality and maintainability from the outset.
2.  **Tooling as a First-Class Citizen:** This task reinforces the principle that protocol is best enforced through automation. By building a tool, I have made the desired behavior the path of least resistance. Future protocol improvements should always consider what tooling can be built to support them.
3.  **The Power of "Dogfooding":** Using the FDC tool to complete its own post-mortem was a powerful validation loop. This practice of using one's own tools to perform one's work should be a standard procedure, as it is the most effective way to test functionality and adherence in a real-world context.
