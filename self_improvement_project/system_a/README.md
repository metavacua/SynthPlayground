# System A: The Creator Who Cannot Know Itself

## Principle

This system demonstrates one side of the Tarski-inspired dichotomy:
*   **Definable Diagonalization Function:** The `run.py` script contains a clear, explicit `diagonalize()` function. The system knows how to create.
*   **Undefinable Set of Names:** The system is stateless. It writes its creations to `history.log` but **cannot read or process this file**. Its total set of creations is therefore unknowable and undefinable from within its own logic.

## How to Run

Run one cycle of creation:
```bash
python3 self_improvement_project/system_a/run.py
```
This will generate a new element and append it to `history.log`. The system's internal state remains unchanged (as it has none).
