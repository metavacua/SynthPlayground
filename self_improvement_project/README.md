# Self Improvement Project: FizzBuzz

This project is a small demonstration of core software engineering skills. It was created in response to the general directive to "Self improve."

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to showcase the ability to:

*   Create a new, self-contained project.
*   Implement a well-known algorithm (FizzBuzz).
*   Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.
*   Follow a structured development process.

This project is not intended to be integrated into a larger application but rather to serve as a standalone example of a complete, tested feature.

## How to run

To run the main program:
```bash
python main.py
```

To run the tests:
