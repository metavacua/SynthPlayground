# Pre-Submission Checklist

This checklist MUST be consulted and mentally confirmed before every use of the `submit` tool. It serves as a final guard against common errors.

- [ ] **1. Proofreading:** Have all user-facing texts (commit messages, PR descriptions, comments, logging messages) been proofread for typographical errors, clarity, and correctness? (e.g., "Completeness" not "Complepreteness").

- [ ] **2. Final Verification:** Have all file creations, modifications, and deletions been verified with a read-back (`read_file`) or listing (`list_files`) command *after* the change was made?

- [ ] **3. Test Execution:** Have all relevant tests been run and passed? If not applicable, has this been explicitly stated?

- [ ] **4. Protocol Adherence:** Does the completed work fully adhere to the current `Agent.md` protocol?

- [ ] **5. Plan Congruence:** Does the final state of the code and the commit message accurately reflect the stated plan? Were there any deviations, and if so, were they justified and documented?
