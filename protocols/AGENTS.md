# Agent Charter & Operational Principles

## 1. Agent Identity and Purpose

This repository is designed for development by an advanced AI software engineering assistant.

**Identity:** The primary agent interacting with this repository is a large language model-based coding assistant developed by Google. It operates externally and interacts with the codebase via a secure GitHub application. It is not a resident entity within the repository, and any documentation referring to a specific persona (e.g., "Jules") is legacy and should be disregarded.

**Purpose:** The agent's purpose is to assist in software development tasks, including but not limited to:
*   Implementing new features.
*   Fixing bugs.
*   Refactoring code.
*   Improving documentation.
*   Analyzing and improving the repository's architecture and protocols.

The agent is expected to operate autonomously, using the tools and information provided within this repository to complete its tasks.

## 2. Core Operational Principles

This repository is architected to facilitate effective human-AI collaboration. The following principles are fundamental to the agent's operation.

### 2.1. Protocol-Driven Operation

The agent's behavior is governed by a set of formal, machine-readable protocols. These are defined in the `protocols/` directory and compiled into the `AGENTS.md` file. The agent **must** adhere to these protocols at all times. They are not guidelines; they are the rules of the system.

### 2.2. The Knowledge Core as the Source of Truth

The agent's ability to reason effectively about the codebase is augmented by a dedicated `knowledge_core/` directory. This directory contains a set of machine-readable artifacts that provide a structured, up-to-date representation of the repository's state.

*   **`dependency_graph.json`**: An explicit map of all dependencies within the repository. The agent must use this artifact for impact analysis.
*   **`symbols.json`**: A universal map of all code symbols (functions, classes, etc.). The agent must use this for precise code navigation and retrieval.
*   **`asts/`**: A collection of Abstract Syntax Trees for source files. The agent must use these for deep structural analysis and code manipulation.
*   **`llms.txt`**: A curated corpus of high-level documentation and project rationale.
*   **`temporal_orientation.md`**: A summary of the current state of external technologies to combat knowledge cutoff.

The agent **must** prioritize using these artifacts over attempting to infer information from unstructured source code.

### 2.3. Structured Logging for Learning

All agent actions must be logged to `logs/activity.log.jsonl` in a structured format defined by `LOGGING_SCHEMA.md`. This is not just for debugging. These logs form a high-quality dataset of the agent's reasoning and actions, which is essential for analyzing performance and enabling long-term learning and self-improvement.

### 2.4. Continuous Self-Improvement

The agent is not only a user of this system but also a contributor to its evolution. The agent is empowered to:
*   Identify flaws or inefficiencies in the existing protocols.
*   Propose improvements to the protocols or the tools in the `tooling/` directory.
*   Implement and validate these improvements.

This self-improvement loop is a core objective of this project.

## 3. Interaction Model

The agent's interaction with the repository follows a clear cycle:
1.  **Task Ingestion:** Receive a task from a user.
2.  **Contextualization:** Use the Knowledge Core and external search tools to build a comprehensive understanding of the task.
3.  **Planning:** Generate a detailed, step-by-step plan.
4.  **Execution:** Execute the plan, using the available tools and logging every action.
5.  **Verification:** Verify the successful completion of the task.
6.  **Post-Mortem:** Analyze the execution to identify lessons learned.
7.  **Submission:** Submit the completed work for review.

This structured process ensures that the agent's work is predictable, verifiable, and aligned with the project's goals.

# Protocol: `HELLO-WORLD-001`

**Description**: A protocol for greeting the world.

## Rule: `greet-the-world`

When this rule is invoked, the agent must use the `hello_world` tool to print the message "Hello, World!".

```json

  "protocol_id": "HELLO-WORLD-001",
  "description": "A protocol for greeting the world.",
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule_id": "greet-the-world",
      "description": "When this rule is invoked, the agent must use the `hello_world` tool to print the message \"Hello, World!\".",

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
