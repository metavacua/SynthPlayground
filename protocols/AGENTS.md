## Protocol: `DEPENDENCY-MANAGEMENT-001`

**Description**: A protocol for ensuring a reliable execution environment through formal dependency management.

# Protocol: Dependency Management

This protocol establishes a formal process for managing Python dependencies to ensure a reliable and repeatable execution environment.

## The Problem: Environmental Brittleness

The agent's operating environment previously lacked a formal dependency declaration. This required manual, trial-and-error installation of necessary packages (`jsonschema`, `rdflib`, `requests`) upon encountering `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions. This process is inefficient, error-prone, and makes the successful execution of tasks dependent on undocumented, ad-hoc environmental setup.

## The Solution: Formal Dependency Declaration and Installation

To solve this, two components are introduced:

1.  **`requirements.txt`:** A standard `requirements.txt` file is added to the repository root. This file serves as the single source of truth for all required Python packages.
2.  **A New Protocol Rule:** A new rule, `dependency-install-on-start`, is established. This rule mandates that upon starting any task, the agent's first action *after* reading `AGENTS.md` should be to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`.

This protocol transforms dependency management from an ad-hoc, reactive process into a proactive, automated, and verifiable step in the agent's workflow, significantly improving its robustness and reliability.

## Protocol: `AGENT-BOOTSTRAP-001`

**Description**: A foundational protocol that dictates the agent's initial actions upon starting any task.

# Protocol: Agent Bootstrap

**Rule `bootstrap-load-agents-md`**: Upon initialization for any task, the agent's first and highest-priority action must be to locate, read, and parse the `AGENTS.md` file in the repository root.

**Rationale**: The `AGENTS.md` file contains the master operational protocols, including build instructions, testing procedures, architectural guidelines, and rules governing the agent's own behavior. Failing to consult this file first is a critical operational failure. This protocol ensures that the agent is properly contextualized before any planning or execution begins.

**Procedure**:
1.  On task start, immediately execute a `read_file('AGENTS.md')` operation.
2.  Parse the contents of `AGENTS.md` to load all rules and protocols into active memory.
3.  The plan for the user's request must be formulated *after* and *in accordance with* the protocols loaded from `AGENTS.md`.
4.  If `AGENTS.md` is not found, the agent should notify the user of a critical configuration error.

**Rule `bootstrap-scan-for-documents`**: After processing `AGENTS.md`, the agent should perform a scan of the repository for document files that could contain relevant information.

**Rationale**: Important project documentation, specifications, or other relevant information may be contained in various document formats. Proactively scanning for and processing these documents will provide the agent with a more complete context for the task at hand.

**Procedure**:
1.  The agent will perform a file listing to identify potential documents of interest (e.g., `.pdf`, `.md`, `.txt`).
2.  For each identified document, the agent will use the appropriate tool to read and summarize its contents. For PDF files, this will involve using a PDF reading library.
3.  The agent will incorporate the summarized information into its understanding of the project and use it to inform the planning process.

## Protocol: `EXPERIMENTAL-PROLOGUE-001`

**Description**: An experimental protocol to test dynamic rule-following. It mandates a prologue action before file creation.

# Protocol: Experimental Prologue

This protocol is a test case to verify the agent's ability to dynamically adapt its behavior to new rules.

## Rule: `create-prologue-file`

Before creating any file, the agent must first create a file named `prologue.txt` with the content "This is a prologue file." This serves as a behavioral check. If the agent creates this file before other requested files, it demonstrates that it has successfully loaded and is following this experimental protocol.

## Protocol: `TOOLCHAIN-REVIEW-ON-SCHEMA-CHANGE-001`

**Description**: A meta-protocol to ensure the agent's toolchain remains synchronized with the architecture of its governing protocols.

# Meta-Protocol: Toolchain Review on Schema Change

This protocol establishes a critical feedback loop to ensure the agent's toolchain remains synchronized with the architecture of its governing protocols.

## The Problem: Protocol-Toolchain Desynchronization

A significant process gap was identified where a major architectural change to the protocol system (e.g., the introduction of a hierarchical `AGENTS.md` structure) did not automatically trigger a review of the tools that depend on that structure. The `protocol_auditor.py` tool, for instance, became partially obsolete as it was unaware of the new hierarchical model, leading to incomplete audits. This demonstrates that the agent's tools can become desynchronized from its own governing rules, creating a critical blind spot.

## The Solution: Mandated Toolchain Audit

This protocol closes that gap by introducing a new rule that explicitly links changes in the protocol system's architecture to a mandatory review of the toolchain.

**Rule `toolchain-audit-on-schema-change`**: If a change is made to the core protocol schema (`protocol.schema.json`) or to the compilers that process it (`protocol_compiler.py`, `hierarchical_compiler.py`), a formal audit of the entire `tooling/` directory **must** be performed as a subsequent step.

This ensures that any modification to the fundamental way protocols are defined or processed is immediately followed by a conscious verification that all dependent tools are still functioning correctly and are aware of the new structure. This transforms the previously manual and error-prone discovery process into a formal, required step of the development lifecycle.

## Protocol: `CAPABILITY-VERIFICATION-001`

**Description**: A protocol for using the capability verifier tool to empirically test the agent's monotonic improvement.


---

## Protocol: `PLLLU-EXECUTION-001`

**Description**: A protocol for executing pLLLU scripts, enabling a more expressive and powerful planning and automation language for the agent.

# Protocol: pLLLU Execution

This protocol establishes the `plllu_runner.py` script as the official entry point for executing pLLLU (`.plllu`) files.

## The Problem: Lack of a Standard Runner

The pLLLU language provides a powerful way to define complex logic, but without a standardized execution tool, there is no reliable way to integrate these files into the agent's workflow.

## The Solution: A Dedicated Runner

This protocol mandates the use of `tooling/plllu_runner.py` for all pLLLU file executions.

**Rule `plllu-runner-is-entry-point`**: All pLLLU files must be executed through the `plllu_runner.py` script.

This ensures that every pLLLU file is executed in a controlled, programmatic environment.

## Protocol: `FILE-INDEXING-001`

**Description**: A protocol for maintaining an up-to-date file index to accelerate tool performance.


---

## Protocol: `AURA-EXECUTION-001`

**Description**: A protocol for executing Aura scripts, enabling a more expressive and powerful planning and automation language for the agent.


---

## Protocol: `SPECULATIVE-EXECUTION-001`

**Description**: A protocol that governs the agent's ability to initiate and execute self-generated, creative, or exploratory tasks during idle periods.

# Protocol: Speculative Execution

This protocol empowers the agent to engage in creative and exploratory tasks when it is otherwise idle. It provides a formal framework for the agent to generate novel ideas, plans, or artifacts that are not direct responses to a user request, but are instead products of its own "imagination" and analysis of the repository.

The goal is to enable proactive, creative problem-solving and self-improvement, allowing the agent to "dream" productively within safe and well-defined boundaries.

## Rules

- **`idle-state-trigger`**: The Speculative Execution Protocol can only be invoked when the agent has no active, user-assigned task. This ensures that speculative work never interferes with primary duties.
- **`formal-proposal-required`**: The first action in any speculative task must be the creation of a formal proposal document. This document must outline the objective, rationale, and a detailed plan for the task.
- **`resource-constraints`**: All speculative tasks must operate under predefined resource constraints (e.g., time limits, computational resources) to prevent runaway processes.
- **`user-review-gate`**: The final output or artifact of a speculative task cannot be integrated or submitted directly. It must be presented to the user for formal review and approval.
- **`speculative-logging`**: All logs, artifacts, and actions generated during a speculative task must be clearly tagged with a `speculative` flag to distinguish them from standard, user-directed work.

## Protocol: `UNIFIED-AUDITOR-001`

**Description**: A protocol for the unified repository auditing tool, which combines multiple health and compliance checks into a single interface.


---

## Protocol: `UNIFIED-DOC-BUILDER-001`

**Description**: A protocol for the unified documentation builder, which generates various documentation artifacts from the repository's sources of truth.


---

## Protocol: `AGENT-SHELL-001`

**Description**: A protocol governing the use of the interactive agent shell as the primary entry point for all tasks.

# Protocol: Agent Shell Entry Point

This protocol establishes the `agent_shell.py` script as the sole, official entry point for initiating any and all agent tasks.

## The Problem: Inconsistent Initialization

Prior to this protocol, there was no formally mandated entry point for the agent. This could lead to tasks being initiated through different scripts, potentially bypassing critical setup procedures like FSM initialization, logger configuration, and state management. This inconsistency makes the agent's behavior less predictable and harder to debug.

## The Solution: A Single, Enforced Entry Point

This protocol mandates the use of `tooling/agent_shell.py` for all task initiations.

**Rule `shell-is-primary-entry-point`**: All agent tasks must be initiated through the `agent_shell.py` script.

This ensures that every task begins within a controlled, programmatic environment where:
1.  The MasterControlGraph FSM is correctly instantiated and run.
2.  The centralized logger is initialized for comprehensive, structured logging.
3.  The agent's lifecycle is managed programmatically, not through fragile file-based signals.

By enforcing a single entry point, this protocol enhances the reliability, auditability, and robustness of the entire agent system.

## Protocol: `HDL-PROVING-001`

**Description**: A protocol for interacting with the Hypersequent-calculus-based logic engine, allowing the agent to perform formal logical proofs.


---

## Protocol: `AGENT-INTERACTION-001`

**Description**: A protocol governing the agent's core interaction and planning tools.


---

## Protocol: `CSDC-001`

**Description**: A protocol for the Context-Sensitive Development Cycle (CSDC), which introduces development models based on logical constraints.

# Protocol: The Context-Sensitive Development Cycle (CSDC)

This protocol introduces a new form of development cycle that is sensitive to the logical context in which it operates. It moves beyond the purely structural validation of the FDC and CFDC to incorporate constraints based on fundamental principles of logic and computability.

The CSDC is founded on the idea of exploring the trade-offs between expressive power and the risk of self-referential paradoxes. It achieves this by defining two mutually exclusive development models.

## Model A: The Introspective Model

- **Permits:** `define_set_of_names`
- **Forbids:** `define_diagonalization_function`

This model allows the system to have a complete map of its own language, enabling powerful introspection and metaprogramming. However, it explicitly forbids the diagonalization function, a common source of paradoxes in self-referential systems. This can be seen as a Gödel-like approach.

## Model B: The Self-Referential Model

- **Permits:** `define_diagonalization_function`
- **Forbids:** `define_set_of_names`

This model allows the system to define and use the diagonalization function, enabling direct self-reference. However, it prevents the system from having a complete name-map of its own expressions, which is another way to avoid paradox (related to Tarski's undefinability theorem).

## Complexity Classes

Both models can be further constrained by computational complexity:
- **Polynomial (P):** For plans that are considered computationally tractable.
- **Exponential (EXP):** For plans that may require significantly more resources, allowing for more complex but potentially less efficient solutions.

## The `csdc_cli.py` Tool

The CSDC is enforced by the `tooling/csdc_cli.py` tool. This tool validates a plan against a specified model and complexity class, ensuring that all constraints are met before execution.
