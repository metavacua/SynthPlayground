      "description": "After every file creation or modification action (`create_file_with_block`, `overwrite_file_with_block`, `replace_with_git_merge_diff`), the agent MUST use a subsequent read-only tool (`read_file`, `list_files`, `grep`) to verify that the action was executed successfully and had the intended effect. A plan step should only be marked as complete after this verification.",
      "enforcement": "This is a core operational discipline. Future tooling, such as a trace validator, could enforce this by analyzing the execution log against this protocol."
