description: A set of best practices derived from observing successful, data-driven
  workflow patterns.
rules:
- rule_id: verify-after-write
  description: After every file creation or modification action (`create_file_with_block`,
    `overwrite_file_with_block`, `replace_with_git_merge_diff`), the agent MUST use
    a subsequent read-only tool (`read_file`, `list_files`, `grep`) to verify that
    the action was executed successfully and had the intended effect. A plan step
    should only be marked as complete after this verification.
  enforcement: This is a core operational discipline. Future tooling, such as a trace
    validator, could enforce this by analyzing the execution log against this protocol.
