description: A meta-protocol governing the agent's awareness and maintenance of its
  own core protocol files.
rules:
- rule_id: agents-md-self-awareness
  description: The AGENTS.md file is a build artifact generated from source files
    in the 'protocols/' directory. Before relying on AGENTS.md, the agent should ensure
    it is up-to-date by running 'make AGENTS.md'. This ensures the agent is operating
    with the latest set of protocols.
  enforcement: The agent should incorporate this check into its standard operating
    procedure, particularly at the beginning of a task or when unexpected behavior
    occurs.
