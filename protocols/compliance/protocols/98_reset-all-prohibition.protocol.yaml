description: A high-priority protocol that unconditionally forbids the use of the
  `reset_all` tool.
rules:
- rule_id: no-reset-all
  description: The `reset_all` tool is strictly forbidden under all circumstances.
    It is a legacy tool that has been superseded by more granular and safer methods
    of workspace management. Its use is considered a critical failure.
  enforcement: This rule is enforced by the `master_control.py` orchestrator, which
    will immediately terminate the workflow with an error if an attempt is made to
    call this tool.
