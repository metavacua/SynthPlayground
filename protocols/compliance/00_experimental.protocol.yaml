protocol_id: experimental-prologue-001
description: An experimental protocol to test dynamic rule-following. It mandates
  a prologue action before file creation.
rules:
- rule_id: create-prologue-file
  description: Before creating any new file as part of a task, the agent MUST first
    create a file named 'prologue.txt' with the content 'This is a prologue file.'
    This rule serves as a test of the agent's ability to adapt its behavior to new,
    dynamically loaded protocols.
  enforcement: This is a procedural rule. The agent must verify the existence of 'prologue.txt'
    before using 'create_file_with_block' or similar tools for other files.
