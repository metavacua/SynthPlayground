  description: A set of best practices derived from observing successful, data-driven
    workflow patterns.
  protocol_id: best-practices-001
  rules:
  - description: After every file creation or modification action (`create_file_with_block`,
      `overwrite_file_with_block`, `replace_with_git_merge_diff`), the agent MUST
      use a subsequent read-only tool (`read_file`, `list_files`, `grep`) to verify
      that the action was executed successfully and had the intended effect. A plan
      step should only be marked as complete after this verification.
    enforcement: This is a core operational discipline. Future tooling, such as a
      trace validator, could enforce this by analyzing the execution log against this
      protocol.
    rule_id: verify-after-write
  version: 1.0.0
- description: A meta-protocol that governs the behavior and evaluation criteria of
    the Code Review Critic agent.
  protocol_id: critic-meta-protocol-001
  rules:
  - description: The `protocols/` directory and all its contents (`.md`, `.json` files)
      MUST be treated as functional source code. Changes to these files directly alter
      the agent's operational capabilities and governing rules.
    enforcement: The Code Review Critic must analyze changes in this directory with
      the same rigor as changes to `.py` files.
    rule_id: protocol-as-source-code
  - description: The agent's execution environment provides a set of built-in tools
      (e.g., `read_file`, `delete_file`, `pre_commit_instructions`). The implementation
      of these tools does not reside within the repository. A protocol change that
      adds a built-in tool to the `associated_tools` list is a valid and complete
      functional change.
    enforcement: The Code Review Critic must not flag a change as 'incomplete' or
      'non-functional' solely because the implementation of a built-in tool is not
      present in the repository.
    rule_id: built-in-tools-are-valid
  - description: A change is considered 'functional' if it correctly modifies the
      agent's operational rules or capabilities, as defined by the combination of
      Python source code and the protocol source files in `protocols/`.
    enforcement: The Code Review Critic's evaluation of 'functionality' must encompass
      both traditional code and protocol definitions.
    rule_id: functional-change-definition
  version: 1.0.0
- associated_tools:
  - run_in_bash_session
  description: A meta-protocol governing the agent's awareness and maintenance of
    its own core protocol files.
  protocol_id: meta-protocol-001
  rules:
  - description: The AGENTS.md file is a build artifact generated from source files
      in the 'protocols/' directory. Before relying on AGENTS.md, the agent should
      ensure it is up-to-date by running 'make AGENTS.md'. This ensures the agent
      is operating with the latest set of protocols.
    enforcement: The agent should incorporate this check into its standard operating
      procedure, particularly at the beginning of a task or when unexpected behavior
      occurs.
    rule_id: agents-md-self-awareness
  version: 1.0.0
- description: A protocol that defines non-compliance with AGENTS.md and specifies
    corrective actions.
  protocol_id: non-compliance-protocol-001
  rules:
  - description: Defines non-compliance as a violation of any rule, convention, or
      procedure in AGENTS.md or its source protocols.
    enforcement: This is a definitional rule. Enforcement is achieved through the
      agent's adherence to the specific non-compliance rules that follow.
    rule_id: non-compliance-definition
  - associated_tools:
    - restore_file
    - run_in_bash_session
    description: Prohibits the direct editing of build artifacts like AGENTS.md or
      README.md. Changes must be made to source files, followed by a rebuild.
    enforcement: Agent must revert direct edits and modify source files, then run
      the appropriate build command.
    rule_id: non-compliance-direct-editing
  - associated_tools:
    - run_in_bash_session
    description: Requires adherence to all documented testing procedures before submitting
      changes.
    enforcement: Agent must halt execution and run the required tests, debugging any
      failures before proceeding.
    rule_id: non-compliance-test-procedure
  - description: Forbids changes that contradict documented architectural patterns
      or coding conventions.
    enforcement: Agent must revert non-compliant changes and re-implement them according
      to standards.
    rule_id: non-compliance-architectural-deviation
  - associated_tools:
    - run_in_bash_session
    description: Requires the agent to maintain an up-to-date understanding of protocols
      by recompiling AGENTS.md when necessary.
    enforcement: Agent should run 'make AGENTS.md' to refresh its protocol knowledge
      and re-evaluate its plan.
    rule_id: non-compliance-self-awareness-failure
  version: 1.0.0
- associated_tools:
  - tooling/self_improvement_cli.py
  - tooling/protocol_compiler.py
  - tooling/pre_submit_check.py
  description: A formal protocol for the agent to propose, validate, and implement
    improvements to its own operational protocols and tools.
  protocol_id: self-improvement-protocol-001
  rules:
  - description: Proposals for self-improvement must be initiated via the `self_improvement_cli.py`
      tool.
    enforcement: The `self_improvement_cli.py` tool will create a new branch and a
      proposal markdown file in the `proposals/` directory.
    rule_id: sip-001
    tags:
    - self_improvement
  - description: Improvement proposals must be formally structured, including sections
      for 'Problem Statement', 'Proposed Solution', 'Success Criteria', and 'Impact
      Analysis'.
    enforcement: The `self_improvement_cli.py` tool will generate a template with
      these required sections.
    rule_id: sip-002
    tags:
    - self_improvement
  - description: Any proposed changes to protocols must be implemented in the relevant
      source files within the `protocols/` subdirectories, not directly in the generated
      AGENTS.md files.
    enforcement: Pre-submit checks will fail if generated AGENTS.md files are modified
      directly.
    rule_id: sip-003
    tags:
    - self_improvement
  - description: After protocol source files are modified, the `protocol_compiler.py`
      must be executed to re-compile the protocols and validate the changes.
    enforcement: A pre-submit git hook will trigger the compiler and block the commit
      if compilation fails.
    rule_id: sip-004
    tags:
    - self_improvement
  - description: The success of an improvement must be verified by running relevant
      tests or a new, specific verification script.
    enforcement: The improvement proposal must reference the specific tests or scripts
      used for verification.
    rule_id: sip-005
    tags:
    - self_improvement
  version: 1.0.0
- associated_tools:
  - tooling/auditor.py
  - tooling/protocol_compiler.py
  description: A meta-protocol to ensure the agent's toolchain remains synchronized
    with the architecture of its governing protocols.
  protocol_id: toolchain-review-on-schema-change-001
  rules:
  - description: If a change is made to the core protocol schema (`protocol.schema.json`)
      or to the compilers that process it (`protocol_compiler.py`), a formal audit
      of the entire `tooling/` directory MUST be performed as a subsequent step. This
      audit should verify that all tools are compatible with the new protocol structure.
    enforcement: This is a procedural rule for any agent developing the protocol system.
      Adherence can be partially checked by post-commit hooks or review processes
      that look for a tooling audit in any change that modifies the specified core
      files.
