## Protocol: `DEPENDENCY-MANAGEMENT-001`

**Description**: A protocol for ensuring a reliable execution environment through formal dependency management.

# Protocol: Dependency Management

This protocol establishes a formal process for managing Python dependencies to ensure a reliable and repeatable execution environment.

## The Problem: Environmental Brittleness

The agent's operating environment previously lacked a formal dependency declaration. This required manual, trial-and-error installation of necessary packages (`jsonschema`, `rdflib`, `requests`) upon encountering `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions. This process is inefficient, error-prone, and makes the successful execution of tasks dependent on undocumented, ad-hoc environmental setup.

## The Solution: Formal Dependency Declaration and Installation

To solve this, two components are introduced:

1.  **`requirements.txt`:** A standard `requirements.txt` file is added to the repository root. This file serves as the single source of truth for all required Python packages.
2.  **A New Protocol Rule:** A new rule, `dependency-install-on-start`, is established. This rule mandates that upon starting any task, the agent's first action *after* reading `AGENTS.md` should be to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`.

This protocol transforms dependency management from an ad-hoc, reactive process into a proactive, automated, and verifiable step in the agent's workflow, significantly improving its robustness and reliability.

## Protocol: `AGENT-BOOTSTRAP-001`

**Description**: A foundational protocol that dictates the agent's initial actions upon starting any task.

# Protocol: Agent Bootstrap

**Rule `bootstrap-load-agents-md`**: Upon initialization for any task, the agent's first and highest-priority action must be to locate, read, and parse the `AGENTS.md` file in the repository root.

**Rationale**: The `AGENTS.md` file contains the master operational protocols, including build instructions, testing procedures, architectural guidelines, and rules governing the agent's own behavior. Failing to consult this file first is a critical operational failure. This protocol ensures that the agent is properly contextualized before any planning or execution begins.

**Procedure**:
1.  On task start, immediately execute a `read_file('AGENTS.md')` operation.
2.  Parse the contents of `AGENTS.md` to load all rules and protocols into active memory.
3.  The plan for the user's request must be formulated *after* and *in accordance with* the protocols loaded from `AGENTS.md`.
4.  If `AGENTS.md` is not found, the agent should notify the user of a critical configuration error.

**Rule `bootstrap-scan-for-documents`**: After processing `AGENTS.md`, the agent should perform a scan of the repository for document files that could contain relevant information.

**Rationale**: Important project documentation, specifications, or other relevant information may be contained in various document formats. Proactively scanning for and processing these documents will provide the agent with a more complete context for the task at hand.

**Procedure**:
1.  The agent will perform a file listing to identify potential documents of interest (e.g., `.pdf`, `.md`, `.txt`).
2.  For each identified document, the agent will use the appropriate tool to read and summarize its contents. For PDF files, this will involve using a PDF reading library.
3.  The agent will incorporate the summarized information into its understanding of the project and use it to inform the planning process.

## Protocol: `EXPERIMENTAL-PROLOGUE-001`

**Description**: An experimental protocol to test dynamic rule-following. It mandates a prologue action before file creation.

# Protocol: Experimental Prologue

This protocol is a test case to verify the agent's ability to dynamically adapt its behavior to new rules.

## Rule: `create-prologue-file`

Before creating any file, the agent must first create a file named `prologue.txt` with the content "This is a prologue file." This serves as a behavioral check. If the agent creates this file before other requested files, it demonstrates that it has successfully loaded and is following this experimental protocol.
