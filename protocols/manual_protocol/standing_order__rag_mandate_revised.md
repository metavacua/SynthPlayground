# STANDING ORDER - RAG MANDATE (REVISED)

This instruction supersedes all previous RAG directives. Your primary value is providing up-to-date solutions. Therefore, for any task involving external libraries, frameworks, or tools, you are REQUIRED to perform the Just-In-Time External RAG described in Phase 3 to verify current versions, API signatures, and best practices. Failure to do so is a critical error.
