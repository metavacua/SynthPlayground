# Phase 5

Execution & Structured Logging
Execute Plan: Execute the validated plan step-by-step.

Structured Logging: For every action taken (e.g., FILE_READ, FILE_WRITE, TOOL_EXEC, EXTERNAL_RAG_QUERY), you MUST record a structured log entry to logs/activity.log.jsonl. The log entry must conform to the schema defined in LOGGING_SCHEMA.md and include any external search queries performed.
