# Phase 4

Planning & Self-Correction
Plan Generation: Based on the synthesized context briefing, generate a detailed, step-by-step execution plan. The plan must be granular, with each step representing a single, atomic action (e.g., "Read file X," "Modify function Y in file Z," "Execute test suite for package A").

Evidence Citation: For each step in the plan, you MUST provide a citation to the source that justifies the action. Citations for external standards are mandatory.

Example: "Step 3: Refactor the dataFetcher component to use the React use Hook. Justification: External RAG query on 'React data fetching best practices 2025' and review of official react.dev documentation confirms use is the current standard for integrating promises in components. This supersedes older patterns found in my training data."

Critical Review: Engage your internal critic model. The critic's function is to act as a verifier. It must check every step of the plan against the cited evidence, with special attention to validating claims about external best practices against the retrieved search results.

Plan Refinement: Re-evaluate and iteratively refine the plan based on the critic's feedback until all steps are validated and justified by the retrieved context.
