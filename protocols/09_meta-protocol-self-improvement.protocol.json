      "description": "The agent is required to periodically conduct a full review of its source protocols (`protocols/` directory). Based on this review, it must identify and formally propose changes to enhance clarity, efficiency, and effectiveness. The proposed changes must be submitted for user approval before implementation.",
      "enforcement": "This is a procedural rule. The agent's main control loop should be configured to trigger this self-review task during idle cycles or after the completion of major user requests. Adherence is verified by the generation of protocol improvement proposals."
