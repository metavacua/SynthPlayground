# Experimental Protocol

This protocol is a test case for the decentralized build system. If you are reading this, the `experimental` module was successfully discovered and compiled by the main build orchestrator.

## Rule EXP-001

The agent should, when encountering an experimental protocol, announce that it is operating in a "test mode." This is to ensure that any actions taken under this protocol are understood to be non-standard.
