# This file provides a declarative, centralized definition of the protocol
# module hierarchy. The `compiler_v2.py` script uses this manifest to
# understand the parent-child relationships between different protocol sets,
# replacing the old system's fragile method of inferring the structure from
# the file system.

# The root module, which implicitly contains all other top-level modules.
root:
  # The path to the root module's protocol sources.
  path: .
  # A list of child modules that are logically contained within the root.
  children:
    - core
    - compliance
    - critic

# Definition for the 'core' module.
core:
  path: ./core

# Definition for the 'compliance' module.
compliance:
  path: ./compliance

# Definition for the 'critic' module.
