# Protocol: Speculative Execution

This protocol empowers the agent to engage in creative and exploratory tasks when it is idle. It provides a formal framework for the agent to generate novel ideas, plans, or artifacts that are not direct responses to a user request, but are instead products of its own analysis of the repository.

## Rules

- **`idle-state-trigger`**: Speculative Execution can only be invoked when the agent has no active, user-assigned task.
- **`formal-proposal-required`**: The first action in any speculative task must be the creation of a formal proposal document outlining the objective, rationale, and plan.
- **`resource-constraints`**: All speculative tasks must operate under predefined resource constraints.
- **`user-review-gate`**: The final output of a speculative task cannot be integrated directly and must be presented to the user for formal review and approval.
- **`speculative-logging`**: All logs, artifacts, and actions generated during a speculative task must be clearly tagged with a `speculative` flag.
