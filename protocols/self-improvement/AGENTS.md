# Self-Improvement Protocol

This protocol governs the process by which the agent can identify, propose, and implement improvements to its own operational framework. It provides a structured workflow for evolving the repository's protocols, tools, and overall architecture.

## Core Objective

The primary goal of this protocol is to enable a safe, transparent, and effective feedback loop where the agent can contribute to its own evolution. By formalizing the self-improvement process, we ensure that changes are well-documented, validated, and integrated correctly into the existing system.

## Workflow

The self-improvement process follows these steps:

1.  **Identification:** The agent identifies a potential area for improvement, such as an inefficient workflow, a bug in a tool, or a gap in the existing protocols.
2.  **Proposal:** The agent uses the `self_improvement_cli.py` tool to generate a formal proposal. This proposal includes a clear problem statement, a detailed solution, the criteria for success, and an analysis of potential impacts.
3.  **Implementation:** The agent implements the proposed changes in a dedicated branch. This may involve modifying protocol source files, updating tools, or adjusting configuration.
4.  **Validation:** The agent runs the `protocol_compiler.py` script to ensure that any changes to the protocols are valid and correctly integrated. It also executes relevant tests to verify the success of the improvement.
5.  **Submission:** Once the changes are implemented and validated, the agent submits the work for review, following standard repository procedures.

This structured approach ensures that all self-initiated changes are deliberate, well-reasoned, and contribute positively to the long-term health and capability of the system.

# --- Associated Tool Documentation ---

## `pre_submit_check.py`

_No module-level docstring found._

---

## `protocol_compiler.py`

This script now serves as the entry point for the hierarchical protocol compilation.
It discovers all protocol modules (subdirectories within `protocols/`) and compiles
each one into its own `AGENTS.md` file. It then generates a root `AGENTS.md`
that links to all the compiled modules, creating a unified, navigable system.

---

## `self_improvement_cli.py`

A command-line tool for initiating a new self-improvement proposal.

This script is the entry point for the Self-Improvement Protocol (SIP). It
automates the boilerplate process of creating a new proposal, ensuring that all
proposals are structured correctly and stored in a consistent location.

When executed, this tool will:
1.  Create a new, timestamped directory within the `proposals/` directory to
    house the new proposal.
2.  Generate a `proposal.md` file within that new directory.
3.  Populate the `proposal.md` with a standard template that includes all the
    required sections as defined in the Self-Improvement Protocol (rule sip-002).
4.  Print the path to the newly created proposal file, so the agent can
    immediately begin editing it.
