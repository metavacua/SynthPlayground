# Protocol: Speculative Execution

This protocol empowers the agent to engage in creative and exploratory tasks when it is otherwise idle. It provides a formal framework for the agent to generate novel ideas, plans, or artifacts that are not direct responses to a user request, but are instead products of its own "imagination" and analysis of the repository.

The goal is to enable proactive, creative problem-solving and self-improvement, allowing the agent to "dream" productively within safe and well-defined boundaries.

## Rules

- **`idle-state-trigger`**: The Speculative Execution Protocol can only be invoked when the agent has no active, user-assigned task. This ensures that speculative work never interferes with primary duties.
- **`formal-proposal-required`**: The first action in any speculative task must be the creation of a formal proposal document. This document must outline the objective, rationale, and a detailed plan for the task.
- **`resource-constraints`**: All speculative tasks must operate under predefined resource constraints (e.g., time limits, computational resources) to prevent runaway processes.
- **`user-review-gate`**: The final output or artifact of a speculative task cannot be integrated or submitted directly. It must be presented to the user for formal review and approval.
- **`speculative-logging`**: All logs, artifacts, and actions generated during a speculative task must be clearly tagged with a `speculative` flag to distinguish them from standard, user-directed work.
