# Protocol: Agent Shell Entry Point

This protocol establishes the `agent_shell.py` script as the sole, official entry point for initiating any and all agent tasks.

## The Problem: Inconsistent Initialization

Prior to this protocol, there was no formally mandated entry point for the agent. This could lead to tasks being initiated through different scripts, potentially bypassing critical setup procedures like FSM initialization, logger configuration, and state management. This inconsistency makes the agent's behavior less predictable and harder to debug.

## The Solution: A Single, Enforced Entry Point

This protocol mandates the use of `tooling/agent_shell.py` for all task initiations.

**Rule `shell-is-primary-entry-point`**: All agent tasks must be initiated through the `agent_shell.py` script.

This ensures that every task begins within a controlled, programmatic environment where:
1.  The MasterControlGraph FSM is correctly instantiated and run.
2.  The centralized logger is initialized for comprehensive, structured logging.
3.  The agent's lifecycle is managed programmatically, not through fragile file-based signals.

By enforcing a single entry point, this protocol enhances the reliability, auditability, and robustness of the entire agent system.

# Meta-Protocol: Toolchain Review on Schema Change

This protocol establishes a critical feedback loop to ensure the agent's toolchain remains synchronized with the architecture of its governing protocols.

## The Problem: Protocol-Toolchain Desynchronization

A significant process gap was identified where a major architectural change to the protocol system (e.g., the introduction of a hierarchical `AGENTS.md` structure) did not automatically trigger a review of the tools that depend on that structure. The `protocol_auditor.py` tool, for instance, became partially obsolete as it was unaware of the new hierarchical model, leading to incomplete audits. This demonstrates that the agent's tools can become desynchronized from its own governing rules, creating a critical blind spot.

## The Solution: Mandated Toolchain Audit

This protocol closes that gap by introducing a new rule that explicitly links changes in the protocol system's architecture to a mandatory review of the toolchain.

**Rule `toolchain-audit-on-schema-change`**: If a change is made to the core protocol schema (`protocol.schema.json`) or to the compilers that process it (`protocol_compiler.py`, `hierarchical_compiler.py`), a formal audit of the entire `tooling/` directory **must** be performed as a subsequent step.

This ensures that any modification to the fundamental way protocols are defined or processed is immediately followed by a conscious verification that all dependent tools are still functioning correctly and are aware of the new structure. This transforms the previously manual and error-prone discovery process into a formal, required step of the development lifecycle.

# Protocol: The Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC)

This protocol marks a significant evolution from the Finite Development Cycle (FDC), introducing a hierarchical planning model that enables far greater complexity and modularity while preserving the system's core guarantee of decidability.

## From FSM to Pushdown Automaton

The FDC was based on a Finite State Machine (FSM), which provided a strict, linear sequence of operations. While robust, this model was fundamentally limited: it could not handle nested tasks or sub-routines, forcing all plans to be monolithic.

The CFDC upgrades our execution model to a **Pushdown Automaton**. This is achieved by introducing a **plan execution stack**, which allows the system to call other plans as sub-routines. This enables a powerful new paradigm: **Context-Free Development Cycles**.

## The `call_plan` Directive

The core of the CFDC is the new `call_plan` directive. This allows one plan to execute another, effectively creating a parent-child relationship between them.

- **Usage:** `call_plan <path_to_sub_plan.txt>`
- **Function:** When the execution engine encounters this directive, it:
    1.  Pushes the current plan's state (e.g., the current step number) onto the execution stack.
    2.  Begins executing the sub-plan specified in the path.
    3.  Once the sub-plan completes, it pops the parent plan's state from the stack and resumes its execution from where it left off.

## Ensuring Decidability: The Recursion Depth Limit

A system with unbounded recursion is not guaranteed to terminate. To prevent this, the CFDC introduces a non-negotiable, system-wide limit on the depth of the plan execution stack.

**Rule `max-recursion-depth`**: The execution engine MUST enforce a maximum recursion depth, defined by a `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH` constant. If a `call_plan` directive would cause the stack depth to exceed this limit, the entire process MUST terminate with an error. This hard limit ensures that even with recursive or deeply nested plans, the system remains a **decidable**, non-Turing-complete process that is guaranteed to halt.

---

# Protocol: The Plan Registry

This protocol introduces a Plan Registry to create a more robust, modular, and discoverable system for hierarchical plans. It decouples the act of calling a plan from its physical file path, allowing plans to be referenced by a logical name.

## The Problem with Path-Based Calls

The initial implementation of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC) relied on direct file paths (e.g., `call_plan path/to/plan.txt`). This is brittle:
- If a registered plan is moved or renamed, all plans that call it will break.
- It is difficult for an agent to discover and reuse existing, validated plans.

## The Solution: A Central Registry

The Plan Registry solves this by creating a single source of truth that maps logical, human-readable plan names to their corresponding file paths.

- **Location:** `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`
- **Format:** A simple JSON object of key-value pairs:
  ```json
  {
    "logical-name-1": "path/to/plan_1.txt",
    "run-all-tests": "plans/common/run_tests.txt"
  }
  ```

## Updated `call_plan` Logic

The `call_plan` directive is now significantly more powerful. When executing `call_plan <argument>`, the system will follow a **registry-first** approach:

1.  **Registry Lookup:** The system will first treat `<argument>` as a logical name and look it up in `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`.
2.  **Path Fallback:** If the name is not found in the registry, the system will fall back to treating `<argument>` as a direct file path. This ensures full backward compatibility with existing plans.

## Management

A new tool, `tooling/plan_manager.py`, will be introduced to manage the registry with simple commands like `register`, `deregister`, and `list`, making it easy to maintain the library of reusable plans.

# Protocol: The Closed-Loop Self-Correction Cycle

This protocol describes the automated workflow that enables the agent to programmatically improve its own governing protocols based on new knowledge. It transforms the ad-hoc, manual process of learning into a reliable, machine-driven feedback loop.

## The Problem: The Open Loop

Previously, "lessons learned" were compiled into a simple markdown file, `knowledge_core/lessons_learned.md`. While this captured knowledge, it was a dead end. There was no automated process to translate these text-based insights into actual changes to the protocol source files. This required manual intervention, creating a significant bottleneck and a high risk of protocols becoming stale.

## The Solution: A Protocol-Driven Self-Correction (PDSC) Workflow

The PDSC workflow closes the feedback loop by introducing a set of new tools and structured data formats that allow the agent to enact its own improvements.

**1. Structured, Actionable Lessons (`knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl`):**
- Post-mortem analysis now generates lessons as structured JSON objects, not free-form text.
- Each lesson includes a machine-readable `action` field, which contains a specific, executable command.

**2. The Protocol Updater (`tooling/protocol_updater.py`):**
- A new, dedicated tool for programmatically modifying the protocol source files (`*.protocol.json`).
- It accepts commands like `add-tool`, allowing for precise, automated changes to protocol definitions.

**3. The Orchestrator (`tooling/self_correction_orchestrator.py`):**
- This script is the engine of the cycle. It reads `lessons.jsonl`, identifies pending lessons, and uses the `protocol_updater.py` to execute the defined actions.
- After applying a lesson, it updates the lesson's status, creating a clear audit trail.
- It finishes by running `make AGENTS.md` to ensure the changes are compiled into the live protocol.

This new, automated cycle—**Analyze -> Structure Lesson -> Execute Correction -> Re-compile Protocol**—is a fundamental step towards autonomous self-improvement.

# Protocol: Deep Research Cycle

This protocol defines a standardized, multi-step plan for conducting in-depth research on a complex topic. It is designed to be a reusable, callable plan that ensures a systematic and thorough investigation.

The cycle consists of five main phases:
1.  **Review Scanned Documents:** The agent first reviews the content of documents found in the repository during the initial scan. This provides immediate, project-specific context.
2.  **Initial Scoping & Keyword Generation:** Based on the initial topic and the information from scanned documents, the agent generates a set of search keywords.
3.  **Broad Information Gathering:** The agent uses the keywords to perform broad web searches and collect a list of relevant URLs.
4.  **Targeted Information Extraction:** The agent visits the most promising URLs to extract detailed information.
5.  **Synthesis & Summary:** The agent synthesizes the gathered information into a coherent summary, which is saved to a research report file.

This structured approach ensures that research is not ad-hoc but is instead a repeatable and verifiable process.

---

# Protocol: The Formal Research Cycle (L4)

This protocol establishes the L4 Deep Research Cycle, a specialized, self-contained Finite Development Cycle (FDC) designed for comprehensive knowledge acquisition. It elevates research from a simple tool-based action to a formal, verifiable process.

## The Problem: Ad-Hoc Research

Previously, research was an unstructured activity. The agent could use tools like `google_search` or `read_file`, but there was no formal process for planning, executing, and synthesizing complex research tasks. This made it difficult to tackle "unknown unknowns" in a reliable and auditable way.

## The Solution: A Dedicated Research FDC

The L4 Research Cycle solves this by introducing a new, specialized Finite State Machine (FSM) tailored specifically for research. When the main orchestrator (`master_control.py`) determines that a task requires deep knowledge, it initiates this cycle.

### Key Features:

1.  **Specialized FSM (`tooling/research_fsm.json`):** Unlike the generic development FSM, the research FSM has states that reflect a true research workflow: `GATHERING`, `SYNTHESIZING`, and `REPORTING`. This provides a more accurate model for the task.
2.  **Executable Plans:** The `tooling/research_planner.py` is upgraded to generate formal, executable plans that are validated against the new research FSM. These are no longer just templates but are verifiable artifacts that guide the agent through the research process.
3.  **Formal Invocation:** The L4 cycle is a first-class citizen in the agent's architecture. The main orchestrator can formally invoke it, execute the research plan, and then integrate the resulting knowledge back into its main task.

This new protocol provides a robust, reliable, and formally verifiable mechanism for the agent to explore complex topics, making it significantly more autonomous and capable.

# Protocol: The Context-Sensitive Development Cycle (CSDC)

This protocol introduces a new form of development cycle that is sensitive to the logical context in which it operates. It moves beyond the purely structural validation of the FDC and CFDC to incorporate constraints based on fundamental principles of logic and computability.

The CSDC is founded on the idea of exploring the trade-offs between expressive power and the risk of self-referential paradoxes. It achieves this by defining two mutually exclusive development models.

## Model A: The Introspective Model

- **Permits:** `define_set_of_names`
- **Forbids:** `define_diagonalization_function`

This model allows the system to have a complete map of its own language, enabling powerful introspection and metaprogramming. However, it explicitly forbids the diagonalization function, a common source of paradoxes in self-referential systems. This can be seen as a Gödel-like approach.

## Model B: The Self-Referential Model

- **Permits:** `define_diagonalization_function`
- **Forbids:** `define_set_of_names`

This model allows the system to define and use the diagonalization function, enabling direct self-reference. However, it prevents the system from having a complete name-map of its own expressions, which is another way to avoid paradox (related to Tarski's undefinability theorem).

## Complexity Classes

Both models can be further constrained by computational complexity:
- **Polynomial (P):** For plans that are considered computationally tractable.
- **Exponential (EXP):** For plans that may require significantly more resources, allowing for more complex but potentially less efficient solutions.

## The `csdc_cli.py` Tool

The CSDC is enforced by the `tooling/csdc_cli.py` tool. This tool validates a plan against a specified model and complexity class, ensuring that all constraints are met before execution.

---

# Protocol: pLLLU Execution

This protocol establishes the `plllu_runner.py` script as the official entry point for executing pLLLU (`.plllu`) files.

## The Problem: Lack of a Standard Runner

The pLLLU language provides a powerful way to define complex logic, but without a standardized execution tool, there is no reliable way to integrate these files into the agent's workflow.

## The Solution: A Dedicated Runner

This protocol mandates the use of `tooling/plllu_runner.py` for all pLLLU file executions.

**Rule `plllu-runner-is-entry-point`**: All pLLLU files must be executed through the `plllu_runner.py` script.

This ensures that every pLLLU file is executed in a controlled, programmatic environment.

---

# Protocol: Speculative Execution

This protocol empowers the agent to engage in creative and exploratory tasks when it is otherwise idle. It provides a formal framework for the agent to generate novel ideas, plans, or artifacts that are not direct responses to a user request, but are instead products of its own "imagination" and analysis of the repository.

The goal is to enable proactive, creative problem-solving and self-improvement, allowing the agent to "dream" productively within safe and well-defined boundaries.

## Rules

- **`idle-state-trigger`**: The Speculative Execution Protocol can only be invoked when the agent has no active, user-assigned task. This ensures that speculative work never interferes with primary duties.
- **`formal-proposal-required`**: The first action in any speculative task must be the creation of a formal proposal document. This document must outline the objective, rationale, and a detailed plan for the task.
- **`resource-constraints`**: All speculative tasks must operate under predefined resource constraints (e.g., time limits, computational resources) to prevent runaway processes.
- **`user-review-gate`**: The final output or artifact of a speculative task cannot be integrated or submitted directly. It must be presented to the user for formal review and approval.
- **`speculative-logging`**: All logs, artifacts, and actions generated during a speculative task must be clearly tagged with a `speculative` flag to distinguish them from standard, user-directed work.

# --- Associated Tool Documentation ---

## `agent_shell.py`

The new, interactive, API-driven entry point for the agent.

This script replaces the old file-based signaling system with a direct,
programmatic interface to the MasterControlGraph FSM. It is responsible for:
1.  Initializing the agent's state and a centralized logger.
2.  Instantiating and running the MasterControlGraph.
3.  Driving the FSM by calling its methods and passing data and the logger.
4.  Containing the core "agent logic" (e.g., an LLM call) to generate plans
    and respond to requests for action.

---

## `auditor.py`

A unified auditing tool for maintaining repository health and compliance.

This script combines the functionality of several disparate auditing tools into a
single, comprehensive command-line interface. It serves as the central tool for
validating the key components of the agent's architecture, including protocols,
plans, and documentation.

The auditor can perform the following checks:
1.  **Protocol Audit (`protocol`):**
    - Checks if `AGENTS.md` artifacts are stale compared to their source files.
    - Verifies protocol completeness by comparing tools used in logs against
      tools defined in protocols.
    - Analyzes tool usage frequency (centrality).
2.  **Plan Registry Audit (`plans`):**
    - Scans `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json` for "dead links" where the
      target plan file does not exist.
3.  **Documentation Audit (`docs`):**
    - Scans the generated `SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` to find Python modules
      that are missing module-level docstrings.

The tool is designed to be run from the command line and can execute specific
audits or all of them, generating a consolidated `audit_report.md` file.

---

## `aura_executor.py`

This script serves as the command-line executor for `.aura` files.

It bridges the gap between the high-level Aura scripting language and the
agent's underlying Python-based toolset. The executor is responsible for:
1.  Parsing the `.aura` source code using the lexer and parser from the
    `aura_lang` package.
2.  Setting up an execution environment for the interpreter.
3.  Injecting a "tool-calling" capability into the Aura environment, which
    allows Aura scripts to dynamically invoke registered Python tools
    (e.g., `hdl_prover`, `environmental_probe`).
4.  Executing the parsed program and printing the final result.

This makes it a key component for enabling more expressive and complex
automation scripts for the agent.

## `capability_verifier.py`

A tool to verify that the agent can monotonically improve its capabilities.

This script is designed to provide a formal, automated test for the agent's
self-correction and learning mechanisms. It ensures that when the agent learns
a new capability, it does so without losing (regressing) any of its existing
capabilities. This is a critical safeguard for ensuring robust and reliable
agent evolution.

The tool works by orchestrating a four-step process:
1.  **Confirm Initial Failure:** It runs a specific test file that is known to
    fail, verifying that the agent currently lacks the target capability.
2.  **Invoke Self-Correction:** It simulates the discovery of a new "lesson" and
    triggers the `self_correction_orchestrator.py` script, which is responsible
    for integrating new knowledge and skills.
3.  **Confirm Final Success:** It runs the same test file again, confirming that
    the agent has successfully learned the new capability and the test now passes.
4.  **Check for Regressions:** It runs the full, existing test suite to ensure
    that the process of learning the new skill has not inadvertently broken any
    previously functional capabilities.

This provides a closed-loop verification of monotonic improvement, which is a
cornerstone of the agent's design philosophy.

## `csdc_cli.py`

A command-line tool for managing the Context-Sensitive Development Cycle (CSDC).

This script provides an interface to validate a development plan against a specific
CSDC model (A or B) and a given complexity class (P or EXP). It ensures that a
plan adheres to the strict logical and computational constraints defined by the
CSDC protocol before it is executed.

The tool performs two main checks:
1.  **Complexity Analysis:** It analyzes the plan to determine its computational
    complexity and verifies that it matches the expected complexity class.
2.  **Model Validation:** It validates the plan's commands against the rules of
    the specified CSDC model, ensuring that it does not violate any of the
    model's constraints (e.g., forbidding certain functions).

This serves as a critical gateway for ensuring that all development work within
the CSDC framework is sound, predictable, and compliant with the governing
meta-mathematical principles.

## `doc_builder.py`

A unified documentation builder for the project.

## `hdl_prover.py`

A command-line tool for proving sequents in Intuitionistic Linear Logic.

This script provides a basic interface to a simple logic prover. It takes a
sequent as a command-line argument, parses it into a logical structure, and
then attempts to prove it using a rudimentary proof search algorithm.

The primary purpose of this tool is to allow the agent to perform formal
reasoning and verification tasks by checking the validity of logical entailments.
For example, it can be used to verify that a certain conclusion follows from a
set of premises according to the rules of linear logic.

The current implementation uses a very basic parser and proof algorithm,
serving as a placeholder and demonstration for a more sophisticated, underlying
logic engine.

## `plllu_runner.py`

A command-line runner for pLLLU files.

This script provides an entry point for executing `.plllu` files. It
integrates the pLLLU lexer, parser, and interpreter to execute the logic
defined in a given pLLLU source file and print the result.

---

## `protocol_compiler.py`

This script now serves as the entry point for the hierarchical protocol compilation.
It discovers all protocol modules (subdirectories within `protocols/`) and compiles
each one into its own `AGENTS.md` file. It then generates a root `AGENTS.md`
that links to all the compiled modules, creating a unified, navigable system.
