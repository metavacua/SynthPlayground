      "description": "If a change is made to the core protocol schema (`protocol.schema.json`) or to the compilers that process it (`protocol_compiler.py`, `hierarchical_compiler.py`), a formal audit of the entire `tooling/` directory MUST be performed as a subsequent step. This audit should verify that all tools are compatible with the new protocol structure.",
      "enforcement": "This is a procedural rule for any agent developing the protocol system. Adherence can be partially checked by post-commit hooks or review processes that look for a tooling audit in any change that modifies the specified core files."
