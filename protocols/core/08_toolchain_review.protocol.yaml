description: A meta-protocol to ensure the agent's toolchain remains synchronized
  with the architecture of its governing protocols.
rules:
- rule_id: toolchain-audit-on-schema-change
  description: If a change is made to the core protocol schema (`protocol.schema.json`)
    or to the compilers that process it (`protocol_compiler.py`), a formal audit of
    the entire `tooling/` directory MUST be performed as a subsequent step. This audit
    should verify that all tools are compatible with the new protocol structure.
  enforcement: This is a procedural rule for any agent developing the protocol system.
    Adherence can be partially checked by post-commit hooks or review processes that
    look for a tooling audit in any change that modifies the specified core files.
