- rule_id: use-chomsky-cli-validate
  description: The `tooling/chomsky/cli.py validate-plan` command must be used to
    validate plans under the CSDC. This tool enforces model-specific constraints (A
    or B) and complexity requirements (P or EXP).
  enforcement: The tool is used by invoking it from the command line with the plan
    file, model, and complexity as arguments.
  tags:

- rule_id: model-a-constraints
  description: Model A permits `define_set_of_names` but forbids `define_diagonalization_function`.
  enforcement: Enforced by the LBAValidator within the Chomsky toolchain.
