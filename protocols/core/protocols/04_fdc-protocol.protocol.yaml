description: Defines the Finite Development Cycle (FDC), a formally defined process
  for executing a single, coherent task.
rules:
- rule_id: fdc-entry-point
  description: The AORP cascade is the mandatory entry point to every FDC.
  enforcement: Enforced by the `start` command in `tooling/fdc_cli.py`.
- rule_id: fdc-state-transitions
  description: The FDC is a Finite State Machine (FSM) formally defined in `tooling/fdc_fsm.json`.
    Plans must be valid strings in the language defined by this FSM.
  enforcement: Validated by the `lint` command in `tooling/fdc_cli.py`.
- rule_id: phase1-deconstruction
  description: 'Phase 1 (Deconstruction & Contextualization): The agent must ingest
    the task, query historical logs, identify entities using the symbol map, and analyze
    impact using the dependency graph.'
  enforcement: Procedural step guided by the agent's core logic, using artifacts in
    `logs/` and `knowledge_core/`.
- rule_id: phase2-planning
  description: 'Phase 2 (Planning & Self-Correction): The agent must generate a granular
    plan, lint it using the FDC toolchain, cite evidence for its steps, and perform
    a critical review.'
  enforcement: The `lint` command in `tooling/fdc_cli.py` is a mandatory pre-flight
    check.
- rule_id: phase3-execution
  description: 'Phase 3 (Execution & Structured Logging): The agent must execute the
    validated plan and log every action according to the `LOGGING_SCHEMA.md`.'
  enforcement: Logging is performed by the agent's action execution wrapper.
- rule_id: phase4-post-mortem
  description: 'Phase 4 (Pre-Submission Post-Mortem): The agent must formally close
    the task using the `close` command and complete the generated post-mortem report.'
  enforcement: The `close` command in `tooling/fdc_cli.py` initiates this phase.
