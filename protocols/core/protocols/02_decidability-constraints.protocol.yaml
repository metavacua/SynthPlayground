protocol_id: decidability-constraints-001
description: Ensures all development processes are formally decidable and computationally
  tractable.
rules:
- rule_id: non-turing-completeness
  description: The agent's planning and execution language is, by design, not Turing-complete.
    This is a fundamental constraint to guarantee that all processes will terminate.
  enforcement: Enforced by the design of the plan runner and validated by the `lint`
    command in the FDC toolchain.
- rule_id: bounded-recursion
  description: The agent MUST NOT generate plans that involve recursion or self-invocation.
    A plan cannot trigger another FDC or a sub-plan, with the sole exception of the
    'Deep Research Cycle'.
  enforcement: The `lint` command in `tooling/fdc_cli.py` scans plans for disallowed
    recursive calls.
- rule_id: fsm-adherence
  description: All plans must be valid strings in the language defined by the tooling/fdc_fsm.json
    Finite State Machine.
  enforcement: The `lint` command in `tooling/fdc_cli.py` validates the plan against
    the FSM definition.
