protocol_id: plan-registry-001
description: Defines a central registry for discovering and executing hierarchical
  plans by a logical name.
rules:
- rule_id: registry-definition
  description: A central plan registry MUST exist at 'knowledge_core/plan_registry.json'.
    It maps logical plan names to their file paths.
  enforcement: The file's existence and format can be checked by the validation toolchain.
- rule_id: registry-first-resolution
  description: The 'call_plan <argument>' directive MUST first attempt to resolve
    '<argument>' as a logical name in the plan registry. If resolution fails, it MUST
    fall back to treating '<argument>' as a direct file path for backward compatibility.
  enforcement: This logic must be implemented in both the plan validator (`fdc_cli.py`)
    and the execution engine (`master_control.py`).
- rule_id: registry-management-tool
  description: A dedicated tool (`tooling/plan_manager.py`) MUST be provided for managing
    the plan registry, with functions to register, deregister, and list plans.
  enforcement: The tool's existence and functionality can be verified via integration
    tests.
