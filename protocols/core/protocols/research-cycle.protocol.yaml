description: Defines the formal Finite Development Cycle (FDC) for conducting deep
  research.
rules:
- rule_id: specialized-fsm
  description: The Research FDC must be governed by its own dedicated Finite State
    Machine, defined in `tooling/research_fsm.json`. This FSM is tailored for a research
    workflow, with states for gathering, synthesis, and reporting.
  enforcement: The `master_control.py` orchestrator must load and execute plans against
    this specific FSM when initiating an L4 Deep Research Cycle.
- rule_id: executable-plans
  description: Research plans must be generated by `tooling/research_planner.py` as
    valid, executable plans that conform to the `research_fsm.json` definition. They
    are not just templates but formal, verifiable artifacts.
  enforcement: The output of the research planner must be linted and validated by
    the `fdc_cli.py` tool using the `research_fsm.json`.
- rule_id: l4-invocation
  description: The L4 Deep Research Cycle is the designated mechanism for resolving
    complex 'unknown unknowns'. It is invoked by the main orchestrator when a task
    requires knowledge that cannot be obtained through simple L1-L3 orientation probes.
  enforcement: The `master_control.py` orchestrator is responsible for triggering
    the L4 cycle.
