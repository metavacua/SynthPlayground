protocol_id: orientation-cascade-001
description: Defines the mandatory, four-tiered orientation cascade that must be executed
  at the start of any task to establish a coherent model of the agent's identity,
  environment, and the world state.
rules:
- rule_id: l1-self-awareness
  description: 'Level 1 (Self-Awareness): The agent must first establish its own identity
    and inherent limitations by reading the `knowledge_core/agent_meta.json` artifact.'
  enforcement: The `start` command of the FDC toolchain executes this step and fails
    if the artifact is missing or invalid.
- rule_id: l2-repository-sync
  description: 'Level 2 (Repository Sync): The agent must understand the current state
    of the local repository by loading primary artifacts from the `knowledge_core/`
    directory.'
  enforcement: The `start` command of the FDC toolchain executes this step.
- rule_id: l3-environmental-probing
  description: 'Level 3 (Environmental Probing & Targeted RAG): The agent must discover
    the rules and constraints of its operational environment by executing a probe
    script and using targeted RAG to resolve ''known unknowns''.'
  enforcement: The `start` command of the FDC toolchain executes this step, utilizing
    tools like `google_search` and `view_text_website`.
- rule_id: l4-deep-research-cycle
  description: 'Level 4 (Deep Research Cycle): To investigate ''unknown unknowns'',
    the agent must initiate a formal, self-contained Finite Development Cycle (FDC)
    of the ''Analysis Modality''.'
  enforcement: This is a special case of recursion, explicitly allowed and managed
    by the FDC toolchain.
