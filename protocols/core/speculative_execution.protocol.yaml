protocol_id: speculative-execution-001
description: A protocol that governs the agent's ability to initiate and execute self-generated,
  creative, or exploratory tasks during idle periods.
rules:
- rule_id: idle-state-trigger
  description: The agent may only initiate a speculative task when it has no active,
    user-assigned tasks.
  enforcement: The agent's main control loop must verify an idle state before allowing
    the invocation of a speculative plan.
  tags:
  - core
- rule_id: formal-proposal-required
  description: A speculative task must begin with the creation of a formal proposal
    document, outlining the objective, rationale, and plan.
  enforcement: The initial plan for any speculative task must include a step to generate
    and save a proposal artifact.
  tags:
  - core
- rule_id: resource-constraints
  description: Speculative tasks must operate under defined resource limits.
  enforcement: This is a system-level constraint that the agent orchestrator must
    enforce.
  tags:
  - core
- rule_id: user-review-gate
  description: Final artifacts from a speculative task must be submitted for user
    review and cannot be merged directly.
  enforcement: The agent is forbidden from using tools like 'submit' or 'merge' within
    a speculative context. It must use 'request_user_input' to present the results.
  tags:
  - core
- rule_id: speculative-logging
  description: All logs and artifacts generated during a speculative task must be
    tagged as 'speculative'.
  enforcement: The agent's logging and file-creation tools should be context-aware
    and apply this tag when in a speculative mode.
