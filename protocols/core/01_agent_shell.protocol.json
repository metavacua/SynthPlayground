      "description": "All agent tasks must be initiated through the `agent_shell.py` script. This script is the designated, API-driven entry point that ensures proper initialization of the MasterControlGraph FSM, centralized logging, and programmatic lifecycle management. Direct execution of other tools or scripts is forbidden for task initiation.",
      "enforcement": "This is a procedural rule. The agent's operational framework should only expose the agent_shell.py as the means of starting a new task."
