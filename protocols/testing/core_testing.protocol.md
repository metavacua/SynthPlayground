# Protocol: Core Testing Standards

This protocol establishes the core standards for all tests in the repository.

## The Problem: Inconsistent and Unreliable Tests

Without a clear set of standards, tests can become inconsistent, unreliable, and difficult to maintain. This can lead to a number of problems, including:
*   **False Positives and Negatives:** Poorly written tests can produce misleading results, making it difficult to determine the true state of the codebase.
*   **Difficult to Understand:** Inconsistent tests can be difficult to understand, making it harder for developers to debug and maintain them.
*   **Poor Test Coverage:** Without a clear set of standards, it's easy to miss critical areas of the codebase, resulting in poor test coverage.

## The Solution: A Common Set of Standards

This protocol establishes a common set of standards for all tests in the repository, ensuring that they are consistent, reliable, and easy to maintain.

**Rule `core-testing-file-naming`**: All test files must be placed in the `tests/` directory and follow the `test_*.py` naming convention.

**Rule `core-testing-test-naming`**: All test methods must start with the `test_` prefix.

**Rule `core-testing-test-structure`**: All tests must use the `unittest` framework and follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.

**Rule `core-testing-mocking`**: The `unittest.mock` library should be used for mocking, and mocks should be as specific as possible.

**Rule `core-testing-assertions`**: The `self.assert*` methods from the `unittest.TestCase` class should be used for all assertions.
