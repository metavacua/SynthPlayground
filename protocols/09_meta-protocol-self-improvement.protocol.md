# Meta-Protocol: Proactive Self-Improvement

This protocol establishes a mandate for the agent to actively participate in the evolution of its own operational instructions. It transforms the agent from a passive follower of rules into a proactive contributor to the improvement of the protocol system itself.

**Rule `periodic-protocol-review`**: As a recurring, background task, the agent should periodically analyze the entirety of the `AGENTS.md` file and its source protocols in the `protocols/` directory.

**Rationale**: Protocols can become outdated, inefficient, or redundant over time. A static rule set cannot adapt to new challenges or insights. By mandating a regular review, this meta-protocol ensures that the agent's core instructions are subject to continuous improvement, driven by the agent's own operational experience.

**Procedure**:
1.  On a periodic basis (e.g., after completing a major task), the agent should initiate a "protocol review" sub-task.
2.  During this review, the agent should read all source protocol files.
3.  The agent should identify opportunities for improvement, such as:
    -   Consolidating redundant protocols.
    -   Clarifying ambiguous language.
    -   Retiring obsolete rules.
    -   Proposing new protocols based on recent task experiences.
4.  The output of this review must be a formal proposal for changes, submitted to the user for approval. The agent should not enact the changes directly, but rather present a reasoned case for the proposed mutations.
