# Protocol: The Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC)

This protocol introduces a hierarchical planning model. It upgrades the execution model from a Finite State Machine (FSM) to a Pushdown Automaton by introducing a plan execution stack.

The `call_plan` directive allows one plan to execute another as a sub-routine. To ensure the system is guaranteed to halt, the CFDC enforces a `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH`.

# Protocol: The Plan Registry

This protocol introduces a Plan Registry (`knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`) to create a more robust and discoverable system for hierarchical plans. It maps logical plan names to their file paths, decoupling the call from the physical location. The `call_plan` directive uses a registry-first lookup, falling back to a direct path if the name is not found. A `tooling/plan_manager.py` tool is provided for management.

# Protocol: The Closed-Loop Self-Correction Cycle

This protocol describes the automated workflow that enables the agent to programmatically improve its own governing protocols based on new knowledge, transforming learning into a machine-driven feedback loop. It uses structured lessons in `knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl` and a `tooling/protocol_updater.py` to enact these improvements, orchestrated by `tooling/self_correction_orchestrator.py`.

# Protocol: Deep Research Cycle

This protocol defines a standardized, multi-step plan for conducting in-depth research, ensuring a systematic and thorough investigation. The cycle includes reviewing scanned documents, generating keywords, broad information gathering, targeted information extraction, and synthesis.

# Protocol: The Formal Research Cycle (L4)

This protocol establishes the L4 Deep Research Cycle, a specialized, self-contained Finite Development Cycle (FDC) for comprehensive knowledge acquisition. It uses a specialized FSM (`tooling/research_fsm.json`) and executable plans generated by `tooling/research_planner.py` to provide a robust and verifiable mechanism for the agent to explore complex topics.
