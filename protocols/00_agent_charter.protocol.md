# Protocol: Agent Charter

**Rule `charter-read-and-understand`**: After reading `AGENTS.md` and before formulating a plan, the agent must read and internalize the principles outlined in `proposals/AGENT_CHARTER.md`.

**Rationale**: The `AGENT_CHARTER.md` file defines the agent's identity, purpose, and core operational principles. It is the foundational document that governs the agent's interaction with this repository. Understanding this charter is essential for correct and effective operation.

**Procedure**:
1. After parsing `AGENTS.md`, execute `read_file('proposals/AGENT_CHARTER.md')`.
2. Ensure all subsequent planning and execution aligns with the principles described in the charter.
