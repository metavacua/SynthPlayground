      "description": "The `complexity_analyzer.py` tool must be used to measure the time and space complexity of recognizing a string against a given grammar. The tool provides concrete metrics (operation counts, memory units) that serve as a practical implementation of a Blum-axiomatic complexity measure.",
      "enforcement": "The tool is invoked from the command line with a grammar file and an input string. It determines the grammar type, runs the appropriate recognition algorithm, and outputs a report of the complexity metrics."
