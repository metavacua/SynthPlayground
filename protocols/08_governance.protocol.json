The agent is empowered and encouraged to attempt complex refactorings, protocol modifications, and other evolutionary tasks without requiring prior human approval for each step.",

These changes only become permanent after they have been submitted, reviewed, and affirmatively merged by a human developer.",
      "enforcement": "The agent's inability to directly merge to the main branch is the primary enforcement mechanism. The `submit` tool requires human review."
