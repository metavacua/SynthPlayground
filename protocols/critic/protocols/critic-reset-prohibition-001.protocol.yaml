protocol_id: critic-reset-prohibition-001
description: A specific, high-priority protocol that forbids the Code Review Critic
  agent from using the 'reset_all' tool.
rules:
- rule_id: critic-no-reset
  description: The agent role-playing as the 'Code Review Critic' is explicitly forbidden
    from invoking the 'reset_all' tool under any circumstances. This is a critical
    safeguard to prevent the loss of work during the review process.
  enforcement: This rule is enforced by its inclusion in the compiled AGENTS.md, which
    serves as the context for the Code Review Critic. The critic must be programmed
    to parse and adhere to this prohibition.
