# Protocol: Protocol Evolution

This document describes the protocol for modifying the agent's own operational protocols. Adherence to this protocol is critical for maintaining the stability, integrity, and security of the agent's core programming.

## Rationale

The agent's protocols are the source code of its behavior. Just as with any software, changes to this source code must be managed through a rigorous, transparent, and auditable process. This protocol provides that process.

## Key Rules

### 1. Proposals are Mandatory

No change to the protocol system is to be made without a formal, written proposal. This ensures that all changes are well-reasoned and that their potential impacts have been considered.

### 2. The Compiler is the Guardian

If a protocol change requires new validation logic (for example, a new field in the protocol schema), the protocol compiler **must** be updated to enforce that new logic. This prevents the introduction of invalid or corrupt protocols.

### 3. Documentation is Not Optional

Every protocol must be documented in a way that is understandable to human developers. This is essential for collaboration and for the long-term maintainability of the system.
