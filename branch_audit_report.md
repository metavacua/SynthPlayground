## 2. Branch-Specific Findings

### `origin/feature/agents-md-meta-protocol`

*   **Commit Hash:** `9e4ecd4`
*   **Purpose:** This foundational branch introduces a complete system for managing the agent's protocols as code. It establishes a self-healing and self-aware mechanism by programmatically generating the `AGENTS.md` file from source files in the `protocols/` directory. It also introduces a semantic knowledge graph (`protocols.ttl`) generated from the same sources to enable deeper reasoning about the protocols themselves.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **Protocol Compiler (`tooling/protocol_compiler.py`):** A new tool that compiles `.protocol.json` and `.protocol.md` files into `AGENTS.md` and a Turtle (`.ttl`) knowledge graph.
    *   **Makefile:** A new `Makefile` to orchestrate the compilation process via a `make AGENTS.md` command.
    *   **Meta-Protocol:** A new protocol (`07_meta-protocol`) is added that explicitly requires the agent to run `make AGENTS.md` to ensure its understanding of the rules is always current.
    *   **Knowledge Core Tooling:** Adds new tools and tests for generating a dependency graph (`dependency_graph_generator.py`) and a symbol map (`symbol_map_generator.py`).
    *   **CI/CD Automation:** Implements a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/update-knowledge-core.yml`) to automatically update the knowledge core artifacts.
    *   **FSM Integration:** The `tooling/master_control.py` is updated to call `make AGENTS.md` during its orientation phase, thus enforcing the new protocol.
*   **Quality Assessment:** The changes are of high quality. The architecture is robust, separating protocol sources, compilation logic, and orchestration cleanly. The inclusion of unit tests for the new tools and the use of a standard `Makefile` demonstrate sound engineering practices.
*   **Protocol Adherence:** This branch *creates* the core protocol for `AGENTS.md` management. All changes are internally consistent and work to enforce the new protocol.
*   **Conclusion:** This is a critical, well-executed feature that lays the groundwork for a more advanced and reliable agent. The changes are approved.

### `origin/feature/automate-system-docs`

*   **Commit Hash:** `73b59f6`
*   **Purpose:** This branch enhances the protocol toolchain by integrating the auto-generated system documentation directly into the main `AGENTS.md` protocol file. This creates a single, comprehensive source of truth for the agent, combining both the rules of the system and the documentation for its tools.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **Protocol Compiler (`tooling/protocol_compiler.py`):** The compiler is updated to recognize a new file type, `.autodoc.md`. When it encounters such a file in the `protocols/` directory, it treats it as a placeholder and injects the full contents of `knowledge_core/SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` at that location.
    *   **New Autodoc Placeholder:** A new file, `protocols/99_system_documentation.autodoc.md`, is added to control the injection point, ensuring the system documentation appears at the end of the `AGENTS.md` file.
*   **Quality Assessment:** The implementation is elegant and efficient. It extends the existing compiler's functionality without adding significant complexity. The use of a placeholder file is a clean way to manage the position of the injected content.
*   **Protocol Adherence:** The change directly supports the goal of having a comprehensive, programmatically generated `AGENTS.md`. It is fully compliant with existing protocols.
*   **Conclusion:** This is an excellent enhancement that improves the agent's knowledge management and self-awareness capabilities. The changes are approved.

### `origin/feature/enforce-decidable-protocols`

*   **Commit Hash:** `aa19b65`
*   **Purpose:** This branch introduces data-driven auditing of the agent's protocols and formalizes a new best practice based on observed successful workflows.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **New Protocol Auditor (`tooling/protocol_auditor.py`):** A new tool that analyzes the `tool_demonstration_log.txt` to perform a completeness check (finding tools used but not documented in protocols) and a centrality analysis (frequency of tool use).
    *   **New Best Practices Protocol (`protocols/06_best-practices.protocol.json`):** Codifies the "verify-after-write" pattern as a mandatory rule, requiring a read-only verification step after any file modification.
    *   **Supporting Artifacts:** Includes the `tool_demonstration_log.txt` as a data source for the new auditor tool.
*   **Quality Assessment:** The new auditor tool is a valuable addition for maintaining the integrity of the protocol system. The codification of the "verify-after-write" best practice is a significant step towards a more reliable and self-correcting agent.
*   **Protocol Adherence:** The changes are fully compliant with the existing protocol structure and enhance the system's ability to enforce its own rules.
*   **Conclusion:** This is a valuable feature that strengthens the project's commitment to protocol-driven development and self-analysis. The changes are approved.

### `origin/feature/generate-security-md`

*   **Commit Hash:** `0e68be8` (Merge Commit)
*   **Purpose:** This branch introduces a separate, programmatically generated `SECURITY.md` file, isolating security-related protocols from the general agent protocols.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **New `protocols/security/` directory:** A new directory containing the source files for the security protocol.
    *   **New `SECURITY.md` file:** A new top-level `SECURITY.md` file that is generated from the `protocols/security/` directory.
    *   **Makefile Update:** The `Makefile` is updated with a new `compile-security-protocols` target to handle the generation of `SECURITY.md`. This target is integrated into the main `build` target.
*   **Quality Assessment:** The implementation is consistent with the existing protocol generation system. It cleanly separates security concerns into their own managed space. The use of a dedicated `Makefile` target is a robust integration strategy.
*   **Protocol Adherence:** The changes adhere to the established principle of generating documentation from source files and are correctly integrated into the project's build system.
*   **Audit Note:** The development history of this branch is obscured by a grafted merge commit (`0e68be8`), preventing a review of the incremental development process. The audit was therefore performed on the final state of the code as represented in the merge, which has been previously reviewed and found to be correct.
*   **Conclusion:** This is a well-implemented feature that improves the organization and management of security protocols. The changes are approved.
