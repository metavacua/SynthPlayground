# Branch Audit Report

## 1. Introduction

This report summarizes a comprehensive audit of the agent repository. The audit followed a systematic plan to assess the repository's health, capabilities, and adherence to its own extensive set of protocols. The findings are based on a combination of automated tool execution and manual inspection of key files and mechanisms.

## 2. Key Findings

### 2.1. Protocol and Build System
*   **Initial State:** The `AGENTS.md` artifacts were found to be out of sync with their source protocol files, as detected by `tooling/protocol_auditor.py`.
*   **Corrective Action:** The `make build` command was successfully executed, which regenerated all documentation and protocol artifacts, bringing the repository back into compliance.
*   **Observation:** The build system itself is robust and includes self-correction mechanisms, but it relies on the user (or a meta-agent) to trigger it when drift is detected.

### 2.2. Tooling
*   **Tooling Health:** The toolset is extensive and well-documented. The `plan_registry_auditor.py` confirmed that all registered plans point to valid files.
*   **Noted Issue:** A recurring parsing error was noted in the docstring for `tooling/fdc_cli.py` during the build process. This does not appear to affect functionality but should be corrected for hygiene.
*   **Refactoring Tool:** The `tooling/refactor.py` script is a good example of a well-designed, special-purpose tool that integrates with the agent's planning mechanism.

### 2.3. Knowledge Core
*   **Plan Registry:** The plan registry (`knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`) is functional but contains only two high-level plans: `deep-research` and `code-health-supervisor`.
*   **Lessons Learned:** The `knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl` file contains several "pending" lessons. Crucially, these lessons have "placeholder" actions, meaning the `self_correction_orchestrator.py` will skip them. This indicates an incomplete self-correction loop, where insights have been recorded but not made actionable.

### 2.4. Core Mechanisms
*   **Agent Shell:** The `tooling/agent_shell.py` provides a solid, FSM-driven entry point for agent execution.
*   **Self-Correction:** The `tooling/self_correction_orchestrator.py` is well-designed to apply machine-readable lessons, but is currently ineffective due to the placeholder actions in the lessons file.
*   **Hierarchical Planning:** The `plans/code_health_supervisor.txt` provides an excellent demonstration of the hierarchical planning system, where one plan can generate and execute another.

## 3. Overall Assessment

The repository is in a good state, but there is a clear gap between the sophisticated design of the self-correction protocols and their current implementation. The system is capable of detecting and reporting on its own flaws, but the feedback loop is not fully closed, as evidenced by the pending, non-actionable lessons.

## 4. Recommendations

1.  **Fix `fdc_cli.py` Docstring:** Correct the syntax error in the docstring of `tooling/fdc_cli.py` to remove the warning from the build process.
2.  **Address Pending Lessons:** Update the "pending" lessons in `knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl` with concrete, executable actions. This will allow the `self_correction_orchestrator.py` to apply them and fully close the self-improvement loop.
3.  **Expand Plan Library:** Consider creating and registering more high-level plans in `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json` to increase the agent's repertoire of callable, reusable workflows.
