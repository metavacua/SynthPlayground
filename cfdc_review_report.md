## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive review of the integration and documentation of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC) within the agent system. The CFDC is a core component responsible for enabling complex, hierarchical task execution in a robust and verifiable manner.

The overall assessment is that the CFDC is **exceptionally well-implemented and documented**. The system's design is sound, the integration between its components is robust, and the documentation is clear, accurate, and consistent. The implementation faithfully adheres to the principles laid out in the governing protocols.

A single, minor recommendation for improving the code-level documentation has been identified.

## 2. Inventory of CFDC Components

The CFDC system is composed of the following key files:

*   **Core Logic & State:**
    *   `tooling/master_control.py`: The execution engine (Pushdown Automaton).
    *   `tooling/fdc_cli.py`: The hierarchical plan validator.
    *   `tooling/state.py`: Defines the `AgentState` and `PlanContext` for the plan stack.
*   **Configuration & Data:**
    *   `tooling/fdc_fsm.json`: The Finite State Machine definition for plan validation.
    *   `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`: The central registry mapping logical plan names to file paths.
*   **Management Tooling:**
    *   `tooling/plan_manager.py`: The CLI tool for managing the Plan Registry.
*   **Documentation & Protocol Sources:**
    *   `AGENTS.md`: The primary human-readable protocol document.
    *   `protocols/09_context-free-development-cycle.protocol.json` / `.md`
    *   `protocols/10_plan-registry.protocol.json` / `.md`

## 3. Documentation Review

The documentation for the CFDC is of high quality across all levels.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **High-Level Protocols (`AGENTS.md`):** The documentation is clear, accurate, and provides excellent context for *why* the system is designed the way it is. It correctly links the abstract protocols to their concrete implementation files.
    *   **Code-Level Docstrings:** The docstrings in `master_control.py`, `plan_manager.py`, and `state.py` are comprehensive and accurately reflect the code's function within the CFDC framework.

*   **Identified Gaps:**
    *   There is a minor documentation gap in the module-level docstring of `tooling/fdc_cli.py`. While the function-level docstrings are excellent, the main module docstring does not explicitly mention its crucial role in performing *hierarchical* validation, which is a key feature of the CFDC.

## 4. Integration Review

The integration between the CFDC components is robust and correctly implemented.

*   **Validator-Executor Parity:** The most critical integration point—the logic for resolving `call_plan` arguments—is handled identically by both the validator (`fdc_cli.py`) and the executor (`master_control.py`). Both correctly implement the "registry-first" resolution strategy. This ensures that what gets validated is exactly what gets executed.
*   **Pre-Execution Validation:** The `master_control.py` orchestrator correctly invokes `fdc_cli.py` to validate a plan *before* attempting to execute it. This is a crucial safety feature that is properly enforced.
*   **Plan Management:** The `plan_manager.py` tool correctly and safely modifies the `plan_registry.json`, serving its purpose as the administrative interface for the plan library.

## 5. Conclusion & Recommendations

The Context-Free Development Cycle is a mature and well-engineered feature of this system. Its implementation is sound, its integration is robust, and its documentation is clear and accurate.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Action:** Update the module-level docstring in `tooling/fdc_cli.py`.
2.  **Change:** Modify the docstring to explicitly state that the tool provides a "hierarchical validator" for the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC), capable of recursively validating nested plans invoked via the `call_plan` directive.
3.  **Justification:** This minor change will make the documentation fully consistent across all components and will immediately clarify the tool's advanced capabilities to any developer reading the file.
