        <h1>AI Agent Self-Improving Codebase</h1>
        <p class="tagline">An experimental environment for a self-correcting AI agent that autonomously manages and evolves its own code and governing protocols.</p>
    </header>

    <div id="overview" class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This repository represents a pioneering research effort into the future of AI-driven software development. It serves as a live experiment for an AI agent designed to be self-correcting and self-improving. The primary goal is to create an agent that can autonomously manage, refactor, and enhance its own codebase and the formal protocols that govern its behavior.</p>
        <p>This is not a conventional software project but a research platform exploring the boundaries of agentic systems and the co-evolution of AI agents and the codebases they inhabit.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="concepts" class="section">
        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <p>The project is built on a foundation of cutting-edge ideas that redefine the relationship between code, documentation, and the agents that interact with them.</p>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3>The Provable Repository</h3>
            <p>Instead of being a simple collection of text files, this repository is architected as a formal, mathematical proof. The directory structure and build process are designed to be logically verifiable. In this paradigm:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Documentation is the Specification:</strong> A component's <code>README.md</code> file acts as a formal contract or "type" that specifies what it does.</li>
                <li><strong>Code is the Proof:</strong> The source code provides the constructive proof that the specification is met.</li>
                <li><strong>The Build is the Verification:</strong> A successful build is a formal, automated verification that the proof (code) matches the specification (documentation). This makes "documentation drift" impossible by design.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3>The Logically-Grounded Agent</h3>
            <p>To interact with a provable repository, the AI agent's own cognitive architecture is grounded in the same logical principles. Its actions are not based on heuristics alone, but on verifiable transactions. This approach aims to create a more reliable, predictable, and secure agent, architecturally incapable of performing actions that would leave the system in an inconsistent state.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3>The Semantic Artifact (Future Vision)</h3>
            <p>The long-term vision is to move beyond a file-based structure entirely. The repository would be pre-compiled into a "Semantic Zip"—a single, monolithic knowledge graph. This artifact would be optimized for machine consumption, allowing the agent to query the project's entire architecture and dependencies instantly, overcoming the cognitive bottlenecks of current AI models.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="modules" class="section">
        <h2>Key Modules</h2>
        <p>The repository is organized into several key modules, each representing a core component of the project's architecture. Here are a few highlights:</p>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3>Custom Languages: <code>aura_lang/</code> and <code>lfi_ill/</code></h3>
            <p>A unique feature of this project is its use of custom-designed languages for defining agent behavior and logical proofs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="aura_lang/"><code>aura_lang</code></a>: A simple, C-style scripting language used for writing high-level agent commands and automation scripts.</li>
                <li><a href="lfi_ill/"><code>lfi_ill</code></a>: An implementation of "Paraconsistent Light Linear Logic," a research-level formal logic for reasoning under uncertainty and resource constraints. This is a cornerstone of the "Provable Repository" concept.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3>Agent Tooling: <code>tooling/</code></h3>
            <p>This is the heart of the agent's capabilities. It contains a vast collection of Python scripts that the agent can invoke to perform its tasks. This includes tools for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building and compiling the repository's various artifacts (<code>builder.py</code>).</li>
                <li>Parsing and interpreting the custom languages (<code>aura_executor.py</code>, <code>plllu_runner.py</code>).</li>
                <li>Analyzing and refactoring code (<code>refactor.py</code>, <code>symbol_extractor.py</code>).</li>
                <li>Managing the agent's own self-improvement and self-correction loops (<code>self_correction_orchestrator.py</code>).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can explore the full extent of the agent's capabilities in the <a href="tooling/"><code>tooling/</code></a> directory.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept">
            <h3>Formal Logic System: <code>logic_system/</code></h3>
            <p>This module provides the concrete implementation of the formal logic systems described in the project's research papers. It contains Python classes for representing logical formulas, sequents, and proofs, and it includes interpreters for various logics. This is where the high-level theory of the project is translated into executable code.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="getting-started" class="section">
        <h2>Getting Started for Developers</h2>
        <p>Interacting with this repository requires a different approach than a typical software project. The <code>AGENTS.md</code> file in the root directory serves as the primary entry point and "constitution" for the AI agent.</p>
        <p>The project uses a unified build system driven by <code>tooling/builder.py</code>. To see available build targets:</p>
        <pre><code>python3 tooling/builder.py --list</code></pre>
        <p>To run a specific build target, such as compiling the protocols:</p>
        <pre><code>python3 tooling/builder.py --target protocols</code></pre>
