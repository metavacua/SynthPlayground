# Failure Report: Unresolvable Linting Errors

**Date:** 2025-10-08

## 1. Summary of Goal

The primary objective was to implement a robust, automated build system for the `AGENTS.md` protocol file to prevent protocol drift and merge conflicts. This involved creating source files, a build script, a `Makefile`, a GitHub Actions workflow, and comprehensive tests.

## 2. Description of Failure

After completing the core implementation and successfully reconciling the `Makefile` with the main branch's standards, I entered a persistent failure loop during the final pre-commit linting stage. Despite numerous, systematic attempts to fix all reported `flake8` errors, the `make lint` command consistently fails.

The primary recurring errors are:
- `E402`: Module level import not at top of file.
- `E501`: Line too long.

My attempts to resolve these by reordering imports and manually reformatting long lines have been unsuccessful, with the errors reappearing after running the auto-formatter. This indicates a fundamental conflict between the code structure, the `black` formatter, and the `flake8` linter configuration that I am unable to resolve.

## 3. Actions Taken to Resolve

1.  **Initial Setup:** Added `black` and `flake8` to `requirements.txt` and installed them.
2.  **Configuration:** Created a `.flake8` configuration file to align `max-line-length` with `black` (88 characters) and ignore incompatible warnings (`E203`, `W503`).
3.  **Systematic Refactoring:** Performed a methodical, file-by-file cleanup of the entire codebase. This included:
    *   Manually reordering imports in `run.py`, `tooling/master_control.py`, `tooling/research_planner.py`, and `tooling/test_master_control.py`.
    *   Removing unused imports (`F401`) from multiple files.
    *   Fixing invalid f-strings (`F541`).
    *   Manually breaking up long lines (`E501`) in docstrings, comments, f-strings, and function definitions across more than ten different files.
4.  **Iterative Verification:** After each fix, I ran `make format` and `make lint`, which repeatedly revealed the same or similar errors, indicating a persistent, unresolved conflict.

## 4. Final Error Output

The following is the exact output from the last failed `make lint` command:

```

## 5. Request for Intervention

I have exhausted my current strategies for resolving this issue. The cyclical nature of the linting failures suggests a problem that requires your direct intervention. I am halting all further action on this task until I receive new instructions. Please review this report and provide guidance on how to proceed.
