This document outlines the formal specification for the `critic` module, as defined by the proof-theoretic build system.

## 1. Propositions (Goals)

This module makes the following formal claims, which are proven by its successful build:

- **critic_artifact**: This module has no defined succedent. It may be a container for other modules. (Produces artifact `artifact.placeholder` of type `Placeholder`)

## 2. Prerequisites (Dependencies)

To prove its propositions, this module requires the following artifacts to be provided as inputs. These are the verified conclusions of its child modules.

- This module has no prerequisites; it is an axiom.
