# AGENTS.md Compilation Comparison Report

This report analyzes the outputs of the five different methods for compiling `AGENTS.md` files in this repository.

## Method 1: `tooling/builder.py`

*   **File:** `build_outputs/1_from_builder.md`
*   **Content:** This file contains a simple list of propositions, extracted from the `proof.py` files in the `protocols/chc` directory.
*   **Purpose:** This appears to be the primary, intended method for generating the root `AGENTS.md` file.

## Method 2: `tooling/generate_agents_md.py`

*   **File:** `build_outputs/2_from_generate.md`
*   **Content:** This file is identical to the one generated by `tooling/builder.py`.
*   **Purpose:** This script is the core logic of the `tooling/builder.py` method, and can be run directly.

## Method 3: `tooling/master_agents_md_generator.py`

*   **File:** `build_outputs/3_from_master_generator.md`
*   **Content:** This is the most comprehensive of all the generated files. It contains a summary of the build commands, a detailed summary of all the protocols, and a YAML-LD block containing the entire knowledge graph.
*   **Purpose:** This script is used to generate a master `AGENTS.md` file that can be distributed throughout the repository.

## Method 4: `tooling/compile_protocols.py`

*   **Files:** `build_outputs/4_from_compile_protocols_*.md`
*   **Content:** Each of these files contains the compiled protocols for a single module. The content of each file is a combination of the `.protocol.md` and `.protocol.yaml` files in that module's directory.
*   **Purpose:** This script is used to generate `AGENTS.md` files for individual protocol modules.

## Method 5: `protocols/guardian/build.py`

*   **File:** `build_outputs/5_from_guardian_build.md`
*   **Content:** This file contains the compiled protocols for the "guardian" module. The content of the file is a combination of the `.protocol.json` files in the `protocols/guardian` directory.
*   **Purpose:** This is a specialized, standalone build script for a single protocol module.

## Conclusion

There are three distinct types of `AGENTS.md` files that can be generated:

1.  A simple list of propositions, generated by `tooling/builder.py` and `tooling/generate_agents_md.py`.
2.  A comprehensive, human-readable summary of the entire system, generated by `tooling/master_agents_md_generator.py`.
3.  A module-specific compilation of protocols, generated by `tooling/compile_protocols.py` and `protocols/guardian/build.py`.

The `tooling/master_agents_md_generator.py` script is the most powerful and flexible of all the methods. It is the only method that can generate a complete and up-to-date `AGENTS.md` file for the entire system.
