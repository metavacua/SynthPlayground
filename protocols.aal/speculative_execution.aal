protocol_id: speculative-execution-001
description: |
  A protocol that governs the agent's ability to initiate and execute self-generated, creative, or exploratory tasks during idle periods.
rules:
  - rule_id: idle-state-trigger
    description: |
      The agent may only initiate a speculative task when it has no active, user-assigned tasks.
    enforcement: |
      The agent's main control loop must verify an idle state before allowing the invocation of a speculative plan.
  - rule_id: formal-proposal-required
    description: |
      A speculative task must begin with the creation of a formal proposal document, outlining the objective, rationale, and plan.
    enforcement: |
      The initial plan for any speculative task must include a step to generate and save a proposal artifact.
  - rule_id: resource-constraints
    description: |
      Speculative tasks must operate under defined resource limits.
    enforcement: |
      This is a system-level constraint that the agent orchestrator must enforce.
  - rule_id: user-review-gate
    description: |
      Final artifacts from a speculative task must be submitted for user review and cannot be merged directly.
    enforcement: |
      The agent is forbidden from using tools like 'submit' or 'merge' within a speculative context. It must use 'request_user_input' to present the results.
  - rule_id: speculative-logging
    description: |
      All logs and artifacts generated during a speculative task must be tagged as 'speculative'.
    enforcement: |
      The agent's logging and file-creation tools should be context-aware and apply this tag when in a speculative mode.
associated_tools:
  - set_plan
  - create_file_with_block
  - request_user_input

This protocol empowers the agent to engage in creative and exploratory tasks when it is otherwise idle. It provides a formal framework for the agent to generate novel ideas, plans, or artifacts that are not direct responses to a user request, but are instead products of its own "imagination" and analysis of the repository.

The goal is to enable proactive, creative problem-solving and self-improvement, allowing the agent to "dream" productively within safe and well-defined boundaries.
