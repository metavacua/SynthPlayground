# Unmerged Branch Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-10-09

## 1. Executive Summary

An audit of all unmerged feature branches was conducted. Three branches were identified containing valuable, completed work that should be integrated into the main branch. While all three are recommended for merging, one branch (`origin/feature/self-improve-error-analysis`) has a significantly misleading commit message that should be noted, though the underlying code is sound.

## 2. Branch-Specific Analysis

### Branch: `origin/feature/self-improve-error-analysis`
- **Commit:** `4d3fb18`
- **Purpose:** Introduces a new CLI tool, `tooling/self_improvement_cli.py`, to analyze the agent's activity logs for inefficiencies, such as tasks that required multiple plan revisions. This is a critical component of the "self-improvement" meta-protocol.
- **Commit Message Accuracy:** **POOR**. The commit message is "feat(CFDC): Introduce Plan Registry for robust plan execution", which is completely unrelated to the actual changes. The code implements log analysis for self-improvement, not a plan registry.
- **Recommendation:** **MERGE**. The code is valuable and directly contributes to a core project goal. The incorrect commit message should be disregarded in favor of the code's actual utility.

### Branch: `origin/feature/temporal-orientation`
- **Commit:** `2a1412d`
- **Purpose:** Introduces a new tool, `tooling/temporal_orienter.py`, that queries the public DBpedia SPARQL endpoint to get up-to-date summaries of key technical topics. This is a crucial defense against the agent's stale internal knowledge base.
- **Commit Message Accuracy:** **EXCELLENT**. The message "feat: Automate documentation and integrate DBpedia orientation" accurately reflects the work done.
- **Recommendation:** **MERGE**. This is a critical capability enhancement for the agent.

### Branch: `origin/feature/protocol-decomposition`
- **Commit:** `c72b229`
- **Purpose:** Decomposes the monolithic `AGENTS.md` file into a version-controlled, multi-file format within the `protocols/` directory. This includes a `protocol_compiler.py` script to build the final `AGENTS.md` from these sources.
- **Commit Message Accuracy:** **EXCELLENT**. The message "feat: Decompose AGENTS.md into a compiled protocol" is perfectly accurate.
- **Recommendation:** **MERGE**. This is a major architectural improvement that makes the agent's core protocol more maintainable and scalable.

## 3. Conclusion

All three audited branches represent significant forward progress and should be merged into `main` to establish the new baseline of capabilities.
