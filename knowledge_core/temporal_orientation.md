# Temporal Orientation Log

This document is a manual log of the agent's pre-task research. It is used to overcome the agent's knowledge cutoff by explicitly recording the findings of external RAG queries. Each entry is timestamped and appended by the agent at the start of a new task using the `tooling/temporal_orienter.py` script.
