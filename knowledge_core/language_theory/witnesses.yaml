  description: >-
    A 'total function' witness for the Collatz conjecture, representing a single,
    decidable step of the computation. It takes a number and a 'fuel' parameter,
    and is guaranteed to terminate.

  witness_id: collatz-control-001
  description: >-
    A witness for the unbounded control logic of the Collatz conjecture. It
    repeatedly calls the 'collatz_total' function until the number reaches 1 or
    the fuel is exhausted. Its termination is undecidable.
