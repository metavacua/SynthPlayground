# Morphism Demonstration: Regular to Context-Free
# This artifact documents the successful demonstration that the set of
# Regular Languages is the initial object in the LangStruct category.

description: >
  This demonstration proves the existence of a morphism from the
  initial object (Regular Languages) to another object in the category
  (Context-Free Languages). This is achieved by showing that a language
  generated by a regular grammar can also be generated by a context-free
  grammar.

initial_object:
  name: Regular Languages
  witnesses:
    - language_theory/witnesses/regular/right_linear_grammar.txt
    - language_theory/witnesses/regular/left_linear_grammar.txt

target_object:
  name: Context-Free Languages
  witness: language_theory/witnesses/context_free/regular_equivalent.txt

verification:
  tool: language_theory/toolchain/recognizer.py
  commands:
    - |
      python3 -m language_theory.toolchain.recognizer
      --grammar language_theory/witnesses/regular/right_linear_grammar.txt
      --string "a a b b"
    - |
      python3 -m language_theory.toolchain.recognizer
      --grammar language_theory/witnesses/context_free/regular_equivalent.txt
      --string "a a b b"
  expected_outcome: >
    Both commands should successfully parse the string, demonstrating
    that the language is recognized by both the regular and context-free
    grammars.

conclusion: >
  The successful verification confirms the existence of an inclusion
  morphism from Regular Languages to Context-Free Languages, supporting
  the claim that Regular Languages are the initial object in the
  LangStruct framework.
