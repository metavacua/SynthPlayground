<file:///app/critic/protocols/built-in-tools-are-valid> proto:enforcement "The Code Review Critic must not flag a change as 'incomplete' or 'non-functional' solely because the implementation of a built-in tool is not present in the repository." ;
    schema:description "The agent's execution environment provides a set of built-in tools (e.g., `read_file`, `delete_file`, `pre_commit_instructions`). The implementation of these tools does not reside within the repository. A protocol change that adds a built-in tool to the `associated_tools` list is a valid and complete functional change." .

<file:///app/protocols/shell-is-primary-entry-point> proto:enforcement "This is a procedural rule. The agent's operational framework should only expose the agent_shell.py as the means of starting a new task." ;
    schema:description "All agent tasks must be initiated through the `agent_shell.py` script. This script is the designated, API-driven entry point that ensures proper initialization of the MasterControlGraph FSM, centralized logging, and programmatic lifecycle management.

<file:///app/protocols/toolchain-audit-on-schema-change> proto:enforcement "This is a procedural rule for any agent developing the protocol system. Adherence can be partially checked by post-commit hooks or review processes that look for a tooling audit in any change that modifies the specified core files." ;
    schema:description "If a change is made to the core protocol schema (`protocol.schema.json`) or to the compilers that process it (`protocol_compiler.py`, `hierarchical_compiler.py`), a formal audit of the entire `tooling/` directory MUST be performed as a subsequent step. This audit should verify that all tools are compatible with the new protocol structure." .
