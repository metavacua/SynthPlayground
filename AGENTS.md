## 1. Project Overview

This is a Python-based project with a sophisticated, self-correcting agent
architecture. The agent's core protocols and knowledge are managed
programmatically and summarized below. The goal of this repository is to
facilitate the development of an AI agent that can autonomously manage,
refactor, and enhance its own codebase.

## 2. System Architecture Summary

This summary is automatically extracted from the detailed system documentation.
It provides a high-level overview of the key modules and their purpose.

The system is organized into the following key directories:
- **`/app/language_theory/toolchain/`**: Contains core tooling, utilities, and logic for the system.
- **`/app/logic_system/src/`**: Contains core tooling, utilities, and logic for the system.
- **`/app/tooling/`**: Contains core tooling, utilities, and logic for the system.
- **`/app/tooling/aal/`**: Contains core tooling, utilities, and logic for the system.
- **`/app/tooling/agent_smith/`**: Contains core tooling, utilities, and logic for the system.
- **`/app/tooling/custom_tools/`**: Contains core tooling, utilities, and logic for the system.
- **`/app/tooling/jules_agent/`**: Contains core tooling, utilities, and logic for the system.
- **`/app/utils/`**: Contains core tooling, utilities, and logic for the system.
- **`/app/utils/gemini_api/`**: Contains core tooling, utilities, and logic for the system.

_For a detailed breakdown of each module, class, and function, refer to the full `docs/SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md`._

## 3. Knowledge Core Summary

This summary is automatically extracted from the integrated knowledge graph,
which includes lessons learned from post-mortems, formal protocol definitions,
and findings from research documents.

The knowledge core contains the following structured information:
- **14** lessons learned from past tasks.
- **43** formal protocols defining agent behavior.
- **86** individual rules within those protocols.
- **2** research documents with key findings.

_For a detailed, machine-readable view of all knowledge, refer to the `knowledge_core/integrated_knowledge.json` file._

## 5. Core Directives & Protocols

The agent's behavior is governed by a set of formal protocols. A full list of
protocols can be found in the compiled `AGENTS.md` files within each module of
the `protocols/` directory. Interacting with this repository requires adhering
to these protocols.
