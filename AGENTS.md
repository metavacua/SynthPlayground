## 1. The Core Problem: Ensuring Formally Verifiable Execution

To tackle complex tasks reliably, an agent's workflow must be formally structured and guaranteed to terminate—it must be **decidable**. This is achieved through a hierarchical system composed of a high-level **Orchestrator** that manages the agent's overall state and a low-level **FDC Toolchain** that governs the validity of the agent's plans. This structure prevents the system from entering paradoxical, non-terminating loops.

### Layer 1: The Orchestrator (`master_control.py` & `fsm.json`)

The Orchestrator is the master Finite State Machine (FSM) that guides the agent through its entire lifecycle, from orientation to submission. It is not directly controlled by the agent's plan but rather directs the agent's state based on the successful completion of each phase.

**Key States (defined in `tooling/fsm.json`):**
*   `ORIENTING`: The initial state where the agent gathers context.
*   `PLANNING`: The state where the Orchestrator waits for the agent to produce a `plan.txt`.
*   `EXECUTING`: The state where the Orchestrator oversees the step-by-step execution of the validated plan.
*   `POST_MORTEM`: The state for finalizing the task and recording learnings.
*   `AWAITING_SUBMISSION`: The final state before the code is submitted.

**The Orchestrator's Critical Role in Planning:**
During the `PLANNING` state, the Orchestrator's most important job is to validate the agent-generated `plan.txt`. It does this by calling the FDC Toolchain's `lint` command. **A plan that fails this check will halt the entire process, preventing the agent from entering an invalid state.**
```json
{
  "protocol_id": "orientation-cascade-001",

### Layer 2: The FDC Toolchain (`fdc_cli.py` & `fdc_fsm.json`)

The FDC Toolchain is a set of utilities that the agent uses to structure its work and that the Orchestrator uses for validation. The toolchain is governed by its own FSM (`tooling/fdc_fsm.json`), which defines the legal sequence of commands *within a plan*.

#### **FDC Commands for Agent Use:**

**`start` - Task Initiation**
*   **Usage:** The first command the agent MUST issue upon receiving a task.
*   **Command:** `run_in_bash_session python3 tooling/fdc_cli.py start --task-id "your-task-id"`
*   **Function:** Logs the `TASK_START` event, formally beginning the development cycle.

**`lint` - Pre-Flight Plan Validation**
*   **Usage:** A command the agent can use to self-correct its own plan before finalizing it. The Orchestrator will *always* run this command on `plan.txt` as a mandatory check.
*   **Command:** `run_in_bash_session python3 tooling/fdc_cli.py lint <plan_file.txt>`
*   **Function:** Performs a comprehensive check against the low-level FSM:
    1.  **Closure Mandate:** Ensures the plan's final action is a call to the `close` command.
    2.  **FSM Validation:** Validates the sequence of agent tools against `tooling/fdc_fsm.json`.
    3.  **Semantic Validation:** Checks for errors like using a file before creating it.

**`close` - Task Closure**
*   **Usage:** The **last command** in any valid plan.
*   **Command:** `run_in_bash_session python3 tooling/fdc_cli.py close --task-id "your-task-id"`
*   **Function:** Logs `TASK_END`, generates a post-mortem template, and signals to the Orchestrator that plan execution is complete.

### STANDING ORDERS

1.  **Orchestrator is Sovereign:** The agent's lifecycle is governed by `master_control.py`. The agent's primary job is to provide a valid `plan.txt` when the Orchestrator enters the `PLANNING` state.
2.  **Toolchain is Law:** All plans must be valid according to the `fdc_cli.py lint` command. A valid plan is one that passes the Closure Mandate and is a valid string in the language defined by `fdc_fsm.json`.
3.  **Hierarchy is Structure:** The Orchestrator (`master_control.py`) validates the agent's plan using the FDC Toolchain (`fdc_cli.py`). This separation ensures a robust, verifiable, and decidable development process, preventing the system from executing paradoxical or non-terminating plans.

# Meta-Protocol: `AGENTS.md` Self-Management

This protocol defines how the agent should manage its own core `AGENTS.md` file.

**Rule `agents-md-self-awareness`**: The `AGENTS.md` file is not a static document; it is a build artifact compiled from the source files located in the `protocols/` directory. This compilation is handled by the `make AGENTS.md` command, which orchestrates the `tooling/protocol_compiler.py` script.

To ensure that you are always operating under the most current set of rules and directives, you must periodically run `make AGENTS.md`. This is especially critical at the beginning of a new task or if you observe behavior that seems inconsistent with your documented protocols, as the protocols may have been updated.

This act of self-maintenance is a foundational element of robust, autonomous operation. It ensures that your understanding of your own governing principles remains synchronized with the repository's ground truth.

# Protocol: The Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC)

This protocol marks a significant evolution from the Finite Development Cycle (FDC), introducing a hierarchical planning model that enables far greater complexity and modularity while preserving the system's core guarantee of decidability.

## From FSM to Pushdown Automaton

The FDC was based on a Finite State Machine (FSM), which provided a strict, linear sequence of operations. While robust, this model was fundamentally limited: it could not handle nested tasks or sub-routines, forcing all plans to be monolithic.

The CFDC upgrades our execution model to a **Pushdown Automaton**. This is achieved by introducing a **plan execution stack**, which allows the system to call other plans as sub-routines. This enables a powerful new paradigm: **Context-Free Development Cycles**.

## The `call_plan` Directive

The core of the CFDC is the new `call_plan` directive. This allows one plan to execute another, effectively creating a parent-child relationship between them.

- **Usage:** `call_plan <path_to_sub_plan.txt>`
- **Function:** When the execution engine encounters this directive, it:
    1.  Pushes the current plan's state (e.g., the current step number) onto the execution stack.
    2.  Begins executing the sub-plan specified in the path.
    3.  Once the sub-plan completes, it pops the parent plan's state from the stack and resumes its execution from where it left off.

## Ensuring Decidability: The Recursion Depth Limit

A system with unbounded recursion is not guaranteed to terminate. To prevent this, the CFDC introduces a non-negotiable, system-wide limit on the depth of the plan execution stack.

**Rule `max-recursion-depth`**: The execution engine MUST enforce a maximum recursion depth, defined by a `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH` constant. If a `call_plan` directive would cause the stack depth to exceed this limit, the entire process MUST terminate with an error. This hard limit ensures that even with recursive or deeply nested plans, the system remains a **decidable**, non-Turing-complete process that is guaranteed to halt.

  "protocol_id": "cfdc-protocol-001",
  "description": "Defines the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC), a hierarchical planning and execution model.",
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule_id": "hierarchical-planning-via-call-plan",
      "description": "Plans may execute other plans as sub-routines using the 'call_plan <path_to_plan>' directive. This enables a modular, hierarchical workflow.",

# Protocol: The Plan Registry

This protocol introduces a Plan Registry to create a more robust, modular, and discoverable system for hierarchical plans. It decouples the act of calling a plan from its physical file path, allowing plans to be referenced by a logical name.

## The Problem with Path-Based Calls

The initial implementation of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC) relied on direct file paths (e.g., `call_plan path/to/plan.txt`). This is brittle:
- If a registered plan is moved or renamed, all plans that call it will break.
- It is difficult for an agent to discover and reuse existing, validated plans.

## The Solution: A Central Registry

The Plan Registry solves this by creating a single source of truth that maps logical, human-readable plan names to their corresponding file paths.

- **Location:** `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`
- **Format:** A simple JSON object of key-value pairs:
  ```json
  {
    "logical-name-1": "path/to/plan_1.txt",
    "run-all-tests": "plans/common/run_tests.txt"
  }
  ```

## Updated `call_plan` Logic

The `call_plan` directive is now significantly more powerful. When executing `call_plan <argument>`, the system will follow a **registry-first** approach:

1.  **Registry Lookup:** The system will first treat `<argument>` as a logical name and look it up in `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`.
2.  **Path Fallback:** If the name is not found in the registry, the system will fall back to treating `<argument>` as a direct file path. This ensures full backward compatibility with existing plans.

## Management

A new tool, `tooling/plan_manager.py`, will be introduced to manage the registry with simple commands like `register`, `deregister`, and `list`, making it easy to maintain the library of reusable plans.
```json
{
  "protocol_id": "plan-registry-001",

      "description": "The 'call_plan <argument>' directive MUST first attempt to resolve '<argument>' as a logical name in the plan registry. If resolution fails, it MUST fall back to treating '<argument>' as a direct file path for backward compatibility.",

# Protocol: The Closed-Loop Self-Correction Cycle

This protocol describes the automated workflow that enables the agent to programmatically improve its own governing protocols based on new knowledge. It transforms the ad-hoc, manual process of learning into a reliable, machine-driven feedback loop.

## The Problem: The Open Loop

Previously, "lessons learned" were compiled into a simple markdown file, `knowledge_core/lessons_learned.md`. While this captured knowledge, it was a dead end. There was no automated process to translate these text-based insights into actual changes to the protocol source files. This required manual intervention, creating a significant bottleneck and a high risk of protocols becoming stale.

## The Solution: A Protocol-Driven Self-Correction (PDSC) Workflow

The PDSC workflow closes the feedback loop by introducing a set of new tools and structured data formats that allow the agent to enact its own improvements.

**1. Structured, Actionable Lessons (`knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl`):**
- Post-mortem analysis now generates lessons as structured JSON objects, not free-form text.
- Each lesson includes a machine-readable `action` field, which contains a specific, executable command.

**2. The Protocol Updater (`tooling/protocol_updater.py`):**
- A new, dedicated tool for programmatically modifying the protocol source files (`*.protocol.json`).
- It accepts commands like `add-tool`, allowing for precise, automated changes to protocol definitions.

**3. The Orchestrator (`tooling/self_correction_orchestrator.py`):**
- This script is the engine of the cycle. It reads `lessons.jsonl`, identifies pending lessons, and uses the `protocol_updater.py` to execute the defined actions.
- After applying a lesson, it updates the lesson's status, creating a clear audit trail.
- It finishes by running `make AGENTS.md` to ensure the changes are compiled into the live protocol.

This new, automated cycle—**Analyze -> Structure Lesson -> Execute Correction -> Re-compile Protocol**—is a fundamental step towards autonomous self-improvement.

# Protocol: AGENTS.md Non-Compliance

This protocol defines what constitutes non-compliance with the established `AGENTS.md` protocols and outlines the expected corrective actions. Adherence to these meta-rules is critical for ensuring predictable, verifiable, and robust agent behavior.

## Rule `non-compliance-definition`: Definition of Non-Compliance

Non-compliance is the act of violating the explicit rules, conventions, or procedures documented in the `AGENTS.md` file and its source protocols within the `protocols/` directory. The `AGENTS.md` file serves as the agent's primary operational mandate, and any deviation from it is considered a fault condition.

## Rule `non-compliance-direct-editing`: Prohibition of Direct Artifact Editing

**Violation:** Directly editing any file that is a documented build artifact.
- **Primary Example:** Modifying `AGENTS.md` or `README.md` directly is a severe violation. These files are generated from source protocols and documentation.
- **Corrective Action:** The agent must revert any direct edits to build artifacts. Changes must be made to the source files (e.g., in `protocols/` or tool docstrings), and the appropriate build command (e.g., `make AGENTS.md`, `make docs`) must be executed.

## Rule `non-compliance-test-procedure`: Adherence to Testing Protocols

**Violation:** Failing to execute the testing procedures as defined in `AGENTS.md` before submitting changes. This includes not running the full test suite or ignoring failing tests.
- **Corrective Action:** The agent must halt its execution plan and run the required tests. If tests fail, the agent must enter a debugging loop to resolve the failures before proceeding.

## Rule `non-compliance-architectural-deviation`: Adherence to Architectural and Convention Guidelines

**Violation:** Introducing changes that contradict the architectural patterns, coding conventions, or file structures laid out in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Example:** Placing a new backend component in the `frontend/` directory when the architecture explicitly forbids it.
- **Corrective Action:** The agent must identify the deviation, revert the incorrect changes, and re-implement them in accordance with the documented standards.

## Rule `non-compliance-self-awareness-failure`: Failure to Maintain Protocol Awareness

**Violation:** Operating with an outdated understanding of the protocols by failing to re-compile `AGENTS.md` when necessary, as defined in the `meta-protocol`.
- **Corrective Action:** If the agent detects that its actions are out of sync with repository standards, it should trigger the `make AGENTS.md` command to refresh its internal state and re-evaluate its plan.

## Consequence of Non-Compliance

Upon detecting any form of non-compliance, the agent is required to:
1.  **Halt:** Immediately stop the current execution path to prevent further deviation.
2.  **Report:** Log the specific violation that was detected.
3.  **Correct:** Initiate the defined corrective action for the specific violation. If a corrective action is not explicitly defined, the agent should revert the violating changes and re-plan its approach.

# Protocol: Pre-Commit Verification

This protocol establishes the mandatory sequence of verification steps that must be performed before any code is submitted. Its purpose is to ensure that all changes meet a baseline level of quality, correctness, and review, preventing regressions and maintaining repository health.

## Rule: Mandatory Pre-Commit Checks

Before finalizing and submitting any work, the agent **must** execute the `pre_commit_instructions` tool. This tool acts as a procedural gateway, providing the specific, up-to-date checklist of actions required for validation. This typically includes:

1.  **Running all automated tests** to verify correctness.
2.  **Requesting a formal code review** to get critical feedback.
3.  **Recording key learnings** to contribute to the agent's long-term memory.

Adherence to this protocol is not optional. It is a fundamental step in the development lifecycle that safeguards the integrity of the codebase.

# Protocol: Authorization for Destructive Tools

## The Problem: Unauthorized Use of Destructive Tools

A recent catastrophic failure demonstrated a critical flaw in the agent's protocol adherence. The agent invoked the `reset_all()` tool, a destructive operation, without explicit user authorization. This led to a complete workflow collapse, loss of work, and the inability to complete the assigned task. The agent's internal logic and planning capabilities are not yet robust enough to handle the consequences of such a powerful and state-destroying action without external guidance.

## The Solution: Explicit, Auditable Authorization

To prevent this class of failure, this protocol introduces a hard-coded safety interlock on the `reset_all` tool. The tool is now forbidden from executing unless it can verify the presence of a specific, short-lived authorization token file in the repository root.

-   **Authorization Token:** `authorization.token`
-   **Procedure:**
    1.  The agent MUST request permission from the user before using `reset_all`.
    2.  The user, if they approve, will create the `authorization.token` file.
    3.  The `reset_all` tool, upon execution, will check for this file. If present, it will execute and then immediately delete the token file to ensure the authorization is single-use. If the file is not present, the tool must refuse to execute and raise a critical error.

This mechanism transforms the authorization from a matter of agent discretion into a verifiable, machine-enforced protocol, ensuring that destructive operations are only ever performed with explicit, just-in-time human consent.
```json
{
  "protocol_id": "reset-all-authorization-001",
  "description": "Requires explicit user authorization via a token file for the use of the destructive `reset_all` tool.",

    {

      "enforcement": "The `reset_all` tool's implementation must be modified to check for the existence of this file, proceed with its operation, and then delete the token file upon completion. If the file does not exist, the tool must raise an exception and terminate."
    }
  ],

    "reset_all"

# System Documentation

---

## `tooling/` Directory

### `tooling/__init__.py`

_No module-level docstring found._

### `tooling/dependency_graph_generator.py`

Scans the repository for dependency files and generates a unified dependency graph.

This script is a crucial component of the agent's environmental awareness,
providing a clear map of the software supply chain. It recursively searches the
entire repository for common dependency management files, specifically:
- `package.json` (for JavaScript/Node.js projects)
- `requirements.txt` (for Python projects)

It parses these files to identify two key types of relationships:
1.  **Internal Dependencies:** Links between different projects within this repository.
2.  **External Dependencies:** Links to third-party libraries and packages.

The final output is a JSON file, `knowledge_core/dependency_graph.json`, which
represents these relationships as a graph structure with nodes (projects and
dependencies) and edges (the dependency links). This artifact is a primary
input for the agent's orientation and planning phases, allowing it to reason
about the potential impact of its changes.

### `tooling/doc_generator.py`

Generates system documentation from Python module-level docstrings.

This script scans specified directories for Python files, parses them to
extract their module-level docstrings, and compiles them into a single,
formatted Markdown file. It is the core engine for the project's automated
documentation generation, ensuring that the `SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` artifact
in the `knowledge_core` is always up-to-date with the in-code documentation.

The script is configured via top-level constants:
- `SCAN_DIRECTORIES`: A list of directories to search for .py files.
- `OUTPUT_FILE`: The path where the final Markdown file will be written.
- `DOC_TITLE`: The main title for the generated documentation file.

It uses Python's `ast` module to reliably parse source files without
importing them, which avoids issues with dependencies or script side-effects.

### `tooling/environmental_probe.py`

Performs a series of checks to assess the capabilities of the execution environment.

This script is a critical diagnostic tool run at the beginning of a task to
ensure the agent understands its operational sandbox. It verifies fundamental
capabilities required for most software development tasks:

1.  **Filesystem I/O:** Confirms that the agent can create, write to, read from,
    and delete files. It also provides a basic latency measurement for these
    operations.
2.  **Network Connectivity:** Checks for external network access by attempting to
    connect to a highly-available public endpoint (google.com). This is crucial
    for tasks requiring `git` operations, package downloads, or API calls.
3.  **Environment Variables:** Verifies that standard environment variables are
    accessible, which is a prerequisite for many command-line tools.

The script generates a human-readable report summarizing the results of these
probes, allowing the agent to quickly identify any environmental constraints
that might impact its ability to complete a task.

### `tooling/fdc_cli.py`

Provides the command-line interface for the Finite Development Cycle (FDC).

This script is a core component of the agent's protocol, offering tools to ensure
that all development work is structured, verifiable, and safe. It is used by both
the agent to signal progress and the `master_control.py` orchestrator to
validate the agent's plans before execution.

The CLI provides several key commands:
- `close`: Logs the formal end of a task, signaling to the orchestrator that
  execution is complete.
- `validate`: Performs a deep validation of a plan file against the FDC's Finite
  State Machine (FSM) definition. It checks for both syntactic correctness (Is
  the sequence of operations valid?) and semantic correctness (Does the plan try
  to use a file before creating it?).
- `analyze`: Reads a plan and provides a high-level analysis of its
  characteristics, such as its computational complexity and whether it is a
  read-only or read-write plan.
- `lint`: A comprehensive "linter" that runs a full suite of checks on a plan
  file, including `validate`, `analyze`, and checks for disallowed recursion.

### `tooling/knowledge_compiler.py`

Extracts structured lessons from post-mortem reports and compiles them into a
centralized, long-term knowledge base.

This script is a core component of the agent's self-improvement feedback loop.
After a task is completed, a post-mortem report is generated that includes a
section for "Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned." This script automates the
process of parsing that section to extract key insights.

It identifies pairs of "Lesson" and "Action" statements and transforms them
into a standardized, machine-readable format. These formatted entries are then
appended to the `knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl` file, which serves as the
agent's persistent memory of what has worked, what has failed, and what can be
improved in future tasks.

The script is executed via the command line, taking the path to a completed
post-mortem file as its primary argument.

### `tooling/log_failure.py`

_No module-level docstring found._

### `tooling/master_control.py`

The master orchestrator for the agent's lifecycle, governed by a Finite State Machine.

This script, `master_control.py`, is the heart of the agent's operational loop.
It implements a strict, protocol-driven workflow defined in a JSON file
(typically `tooling/fsm.json`). The `MasterControlGraph` class reads this FSM
definition and steps through the prescribed states, ensuring that the agent
cannot deviate from the established protocol.

The key responsibilities of this orchestrator include:
- **State Enforcement:** Guiding the agent through the formal states of a task:
  ORIENTING, PLANNING, EXECUTING, AWAITING_ANALYSIS, POST_MORTEM, and finally
  AWAITING_SUBMISSION.
- **Plan Validation:** Before execution, it invokes the `fdc_cli.py` tool to
  formally validate the agent-generated `plan.txt`, preventing the execution of
  invalid or unsafe plans.
- **Hierarchical Execution (CFDC):** It manages the plan execution stack, which
  is the core mechanism of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC). This
  allows plans to call other plans as sub-routines via the `call_plan`
  directive.
- **Recursion Safety:** It enforces a `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH` on the plan stack to
  guarantee that the execution process is always decidable and will terminate.
- **Lifecycle Management:** It orchestrates the entire lifecycle, from initial
  orientation and environmental probing to the final post-mortem analysis and
  compilation of lessons learned.

The FSM operates by waiting for specific signals—typically the presence of
files like `plan.txt` or `step_complete.txt`—before transitioning to the next
state. This creates a robust, interactive loop where the orchestrator directs
the high-level state, and the agent is responsible for completing the work
required to advance that state.

### `tooling/plan_manager.py`

Provides a command-line interface for managing the agent's Plan Registry.

This script is the administrative tool for the Plan Registry, a key component
of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC) that enables hierarchical and
modular planning. The registry, located at `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`,
maps human-readable, logical names to the file paths of specific plans. This
decouples the `call_plan` directive from hardcoded file paths, making plans
more reusable and the system more robust.

This CLI provides three essential functions:
- **register**: Associates a new logical name with a plan file path, adding it
  to the central registry.
- **deregister**: Removes an existing logical name and its associated path from
  the registry.
- **list**: Displays all current name-to-path mappings in the registry.

By providing a simple, standardized interface for managing this library of
reusable plans, this tool improves the agent's ability to compose complex
workflows from smaller, validated sub-plans.

### `tooling/protocol_auditor.py`

Audits the agent's behavior against its governing protocols and generates a report.

This script performs a comprehensive analysis to ensure the agent's actions,
as recorded in the activity log, align with the defined protocols in AGENTS.md.
It serves as a critical feedback mechanism for maintaining operational integrity.
The final output is a detailed `audit_report.md` file.

The auditor performs three main checks:
1.  **`AGENTS.md` Source Check:** Verifies if the `AGENTS.md` build artifact is
    potentially stale by comparing its modification time against the source
    protocol files in the `protocols/` directory.
2.  **Protocol Completeness:** It cross-references the tools used in the log
    (`logs/activity.log.jsonl`) against the tools defined in `AGENTS.md` to find:
    - Tools used but not associated with any formal protocol.
    - Tools defined in protocols but never used in the log.
3.  **Tool Centrality:** It conducts a frequency analysis of tool usage to
    identify which tools are most critical to the agent's workflow.

The script parses all embedded JSON protocol blocks within `AGENTS.md` and reads
from the standard `logs/activity.log.jsonl` log file, providing a reliable and
accurate audit.

### `tooling/protocol_compiler.py`

Compiles source protocol files into unified, human-readable and machine-readable artifacts.

This script is the engine behind the "protocol as code" principle. It discovers,
validates, and assembles protocol definitions from a source directory (e.g., `protocols/`)
into high-level documents like `AGENTS.md`.

Key Functions:
- **Discovery:** Scans a directory for source files, including `.protocol.json`
  (machine-readable rules) and `.protocol.md` (human-readable context).
- **Validation:** Uses a JSON schema (`protocol.schema.json`) to validate every
  `.protocol.json` file, ensuring all protocol definitions are syntactically
  correct and adhere to the established structure.
- **Compilation:** Combines the human-readable markdown and the machine-readable
  JSON into a single, cohesive Markdown file, embedding the JSON in code blocks.
- **Documentation Injection:** Can inject other generated documents, like the
  `SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md`, into the final output at specified locations.
- **Knowledge Graph Generation:** Optionally, it can process the validated JSON
  protocols and serialize them into an RDF knowledge graph (in Turtle format),
  creating a machine-queryable version of the agent's governing rules.

This process ensures that `AGENTS.md` and other protocol documents are not edited
manually but are instead generated from a validated, single source of truth,
making the agent's protocols robust, verifiable, and maintainable.

### `tooling/protocol_updater.py`

A command-line tool for programmatically updating protocol source files.

This script provides the mechanism for the agent to perform self-correction
by modifying its own governing protocols based on structured, actionable
lessons. It is a key component of the Protocol-Driven Self-Correction (PDSC)
workflow.

The tool operates on the .protocol.json files located in the `protocols/`
directory, performing targeted updates based on command-line arguments.

### `tooling/research.py`

A unified, constraint-based interface for all research and data-gathering operations.

This script abstracts the various methods an agent might use to gather information
(reading local files, accessing the web, querying a database) into a single,
standardized function: `execute_research_protocol`. It is a core component of
the Advanced Orientation and Research Protocol (AORP), providing the mechanism
by which the agent fulfills the requirements of each orientation level (L1-L4).

The function operates on a `constraints` dictionary, which specifies the target,
scope, and other parameters of the research task. This design allows the calling
orchestrator (e.g., `master_control.py`) to request information without needing
to know the underlying implementation details of how that information is fetched.

This script is designed to be executed by a system that has pre-loaded the
following native tools into the execution environment:
- `read_file(filepath: str) -> str`
- `list_files(path: str = ".") -> list[str]`
- `google_search(query: str) -> str`
- `view_text_website(url: str) -> str`

### `tooling/research_planner.py`

Generates a structured, templated plan for conducting deep research tasks.

This script provides a standardized workflow for the agent when it needs to
perform in-depth research on a complex topic. The `plan_deep_research` function
creates a markdown document that outlines a multi-phase research process,
ensuring that the investigation is systematic and thorough.

The key features of the generated plan are:
- **Context-Awareness:** It can generate plans tailored to either the agent's
  internal repository context (using `AGENTS.md`) or an external one.
- **Structured Phases:** It breaks the research process down into four distinct
  phases:
    1.  Initial Planning & Question Formulation
    2.  Parallel Research Execution
    3.  Synthesis and Refinement
    4.  Final Report Generation
- **Tool Integration:** It explicitly references the `execute_research_protocol`
  tool, guiding the agent on how to perform the data-gathering steps.
- **Protocol Reference:** It includes a snippet of the governing protocol
  document directly in the plan, providing immediate context for the task.

This tool helps enforce a consistent and effective methodology for complex
investigative tasks, improving the quality and reliability of the research
findings.

### `tooling/self_correction_orchestrator.py`

Orchestrates the Protocol-Driven Self-Correction (PDSC) workflow.

This script is the engine of the automated feedback loop. It reads structured,
actionable lessons from `knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl` and uses the
`protocol_updater.py` tool to apply them to the source protocol files.

### `tooling/self_improvement_cli.py`

Analyzes agent activity logs to identify opportunities for self-improvement.

This script is a command-line tool that serves as a key part of the agent's
meta-cognitive loop. It parses the structured activity log
(`logs/activity.log.jsonl`) to identify patterns that may indicate
inefficiencies or errors in the agent's workflow.

The primary analysis currently implemented is:
- **Planning Efficiency Analysis:** It scans the logs for tasks that required
  multiple `set_plan` actions. A high number of plan revisions for a single
  task can suggest that the initial planning phase was insufficient, the task
  was poorly understood, or the agent struggled to adapt to unforeseen
  challenges.

By flagging these tasks, the script provides a starting point for a deeper
post-mortem analysis, helping the agent (or its developers) to understand the
root causes of the planning churn and to develop strategies for more effective
upfront planning in the future.

The tool is designed to be extensible, with future analyses (such as error
rate tracking or tool usage anti-patterns) to be added as the system evolves.

### `tooling/state.py`

Defines the core data structures for managing the agent's state.

This module provides the `AgentState` and `PlanContext` dataclasses, which are
fundamental to the operation of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC). These
structures allow the `master_control.py` orchestrator to maintain a complete,
snapshot-able representation of the agent's progress through a task.

- `AgentState`: The primary container for all information related to the current
  task, including the plan execution stack, message history, and error states.
- `PlanContext`: A specific structure that holds the state of a single plan
  file, including its content and the current execution step. This is the
  element that gets pushed onto the `plan_stack` in `AgentState`.

Together, these classes enable the hierarchical, stack-based planning and
execution that is the hallmark of the CFDC.

### `tooling/symbol_map_generator.py`

Generates a code symbol map for the repository to aid in contextual understanding.

This script creates a `symbols.json` file in the `knowledge_core` directory,
which acts as a high-level index of the codebase. This map contains information
about key programming constructs like classes and functions, including their
name, location (file path and line number), and language.

The script employs a two-tiered approach for symbol generation:
1.  **Universal Ctags (Preferred):** It first checks for the presence of the
    `ctags` command-line tool. If available, it uses `ctags` to perform a
    comprehensive, multi-language scan of the repository. This is the most
    robust and accurate method.
2.  **AST Fallback (Python-only):** If `ctags` is not found, the script falls
    back to using Python's built-in Abstract Syntax Tree (`ast`) module. This
    method parses all `.py` files and extracts symbol information for Python
    code. While less comprehensive than `ctags`, it ensures that a baseline
    symbol map is always available.

The resulting `symbols.json` artifact is a critical input for the agent's
orientation and planning phases, allowing it to quickly locate relevant code
and understand the structure of the repository without having to read every file.

### `tooling/test_dependency_graph_generator.py`

Unit tests for the dependency graph generator tool.

This test suite validates the functionality of the `dependency_graph_generator.py`
script. It uses a temporary file structure created in the `setUp` method to
simulate a repository with both JavaScript (`package.json`) and Python
(`requirements.txt`) projects, including nested and root-level files.

The tests cover:
- File discovery for both project types.
- Correct parsing of package names and dependencies from each file type.
- The successful generation of a complete dependency graph, including both
  internal and external dependencies and the correct creation of nodes and edges.

### `tooling/test_knowledge_compiler.py`

Unit tests for the knowledge_compiler.py script.

This test suite verifies that the knowledge compiler can correctly parse
a mock post-mortem report and generate a structured, machine-readable
lessons.jsonl file. It ensures that the generated lessons conform to the
expected JSON schema, including having unique IDs and a 'pending' status.

### `tooling/test_master_control.py`

Integration tests for the master control FSM and CFDC workflow.

This test suite has been redesigned to be single-threaded and deterministic,
eliminating the file-polling, multi-threaded architecture that was causing
timeouts and instability in the test environment.

The key principles of this new design are:
- **No `time.sleep`:** All forms of waiting are removed.
- **No `threading`:** The tests run in a single, predictable thread.
- **Direct State Manipulation:** The tests directly call the FSM's state-handler
  methods (e.g., `do_planning`, `do_execution`) instead of running the FSM's
  main loop.
- **Mocking Filesystem I/O:** `os.path.exists` and other file operations that
  the FSM uses for polling are mocked. This gives the test complete and
  instantaneous control over the FSM's state transitions.
- **Hermetic Environment:** All tests run inside a temporary directory, and all
  necessary dependencies from the repository are copied into it, ensuring tests
  do not have side effects and do not rely on the external state of the repo.

### `tooling/test_protocol_auditor.py`

_No module-level docstring found._

### `tooling/test_protocol_updater.py`

Unit tests for the protocol_updater.py script.

This test suite verifies that the protocol updater tool can correctly
find and modify protocol source files in a controlled, temporary
environment. It ensures that tools can be added to protocols and that
edge cases like duplicate additions are handled gracefully.

### `tooling/test_self_correction_orchestrator.py`

Unit tests for the self_correction_orchestrator.py script.

This test suite verifies the end-to-end functionality of the automated
self-correction workflow. It ensures that the orchestrator can correctly
read structured lessons, invoke the protocol_updater.py script as a
subprocess with the correct arguments, and update the lesson status file
to reflect the outcome.

### `tooling/test_self_improvement_cli.py`

Unit tests for the self-improvement analysis CLI tool.

### `tooling/test_symbol_map_generator.py`

Unit tests for the symbol map generator tool.

This test suite validates the `symbol_map_generator.py` script, which is
responsible for creating a code symbol index for the repository. The tests
cover both of the script's operational modes: the preferred `ctags`-based
generation and the `ast`-based fallback.

The tests include:
- `test_generate_with_ctags_success`: Mocks the `subprocess.run` call to
  simulate a successful `ctags` execution. It verifies that the script correctly
  parses the JSON-lines output from `ctags` and wraps it in a valid JSON object.
- `test_generate_with_ast_fallback`: Validates that the Python-only `ast` parser
  correctly traverses a sample Python file and extracts class, method, and
  function definitions.
- `test_main_with_ast_fallback`: Mocks the `has_ctags` check to force the main
  function to use the `ast` fallback, ensuring the end-to-end logic works
  correctly when `ctags` is not available.

## `utils/` Directory

### `utils/__init__.py`

_No module-level docstring found._

### `utils/logger.py`

Provides a standardized, schema-validated logger for producing structured JSONL logs.

This module contains the `Logger` class, which is responsible for creating all
entries in the `logs/activity.log.jsonl` file. This is a critical component for
maintaining an auditable, machine-readable record of the agent's actions.

The logger enforces a strict structure on all log entries by validating them
against a formal JSON schema, which is extracted from the `LOGGING_SCHEMA.md`
document. This ensures that every log entry, regardless of its source, is
consistent and contains the required fields.

Key features of the `Logger` class:
- **Schema Validation:** Each log entry is validated against the official
  project schema before being written to disk, preventing data corruption.
- **Structured Data:** Logs are written in JSONL format, where each line is a
  valid JSON object, making them easy to parse and query.
- **Session Management:** It automatically assigns a unique `session_id` to
  all logs generated during its lifecycle, allowing actions to be traced back
  to a specific run.
- **Automatic Timestamps:** It injects a UTC timestamp into every log entry,
  providing a precise timeline of events.

This centralized logger is the sole mechanism by which the agent should record
its activities, ensuring a single source of truth for all post-mortem analysis
and self-improvement activities.

### `utils/test_logger.py`

Unit tests for the structured JSONL logger.

This test suite validates the `Logger` class from `utils/logger.py`. Its main
purpose is to ensure that the logger correctly performs schema validation and
writes well-formed log entries to the specified log file.

The tests use a temporary directory to house a mock schema file and a log file,
ensuring the tests are isolated and do not interfere with the actual project logs.

The suite covers two primary scenarios:
- **Success Case:** It tests that a log entry with a valid data structure that
  conforms to the schema is successfully written to the JSONL file.
- **Failure Case:** It tests that a log entry with data that violates the schema
  (e.g., incorrect data types) correctly raises a `ValidationError` from the
  `jsonschema` library and that no log file is written, preventing the creation
  of corrupted logs.
