### `tooling/__init__.py`

_No module-level docstring found._

### `tooling/agent_shell.py`

The new, interactive, API-driven entry point for the agent.

This script replaces the old file-based signaling system with a direct,
programmatic interface to the MasterControlGraph FSM. It is responsible for:
1.  Initializing the agent's state and a centralized logger.
2.  Instantiating and running the MasterControlGraph.
3.  Driving the FSM by calling its methods and passing data and the logger.
4.  Containing the core "agent logic" (e.g., an LLM call) to generate plans
    and respond to requests for action.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def find_fsm_transition(fsm, source_state, trigger)`

  > Finds the destination state for a given source and trigger.


- #### `def main()`

  > Main entry point for the agent shell.


- #### `def run_agent_loop(task_description)`

  > The main loop that drives the agent's lifecycle via the FSM.


### `tooling/code_suggester.py`

Handles the generation and application of autonomous code change suggestions.

This tool is a key component of the advanced self-correction loop. It is
designed to be invoked by the self-correction orchestrator when a lesson
contains a 'propose-code-change' action.

For its initial implementation, this tool acts as a structured executor. It
takes a lesson where the 'details' field contains a fully-formed git-style
merge diff and applies it to the target file. It does this by generating a
temporary, single-step plan file and signaling its location for the master
controller to execute.

This establishes the fundamental workflow for autonomous code modification,
decoupling the suggestion logic from the execution logic. Future iterations
can enhance this tool with more sophisticated code generation capabilities
(e.g., using an LLM to generate the diff from a natural language description)
without altering the core orchestration process.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def generate_suggestion_plan(filepath, diff_content)`

  > Generates a temporary, single-step plan file to apply a code change.
  >
  > Args:
  >     filepath: The path to the file that needs to be modified.
  >     diff_content: The git-style merge diff block to be applied.
  >
  > Returns:
  >     The path to the generated temporary plan file.


- #### `def main()`

  > Main entry point for the code suggester tool.
  > Parses arguments, generates a plan, and prints the plan's path to stdout.


### `tooling/context_awareness_scanner.py`

_No module-level docstring found._


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def find_references(symbol_name, search_path)`

  > Finds all files in a directory that reference a given symbol.


- #### `def get_defined_symbols(filepath)`

  > Parses a Python file to find all defined functions and classes.


- #### `def get_imported_symbols(filepath)`

  > Parses a Python file to find all imported modules and symbols.


- #### `def main()`


### `tooling/dependency_graph_generator.py`

Scans the repository for dependency files and generates a unified dependency graph.

This script is a crucial component of the agent's environmental awareness,
providing a clear map of the software supply chain. It recursively searches the
entire repository for common dependency management files, specifically:
- `package.json` (for JavaScript/Node.js projects)
- `requirements.txt` (for Python projects)

It parses these files to identify two key types of relationships:
1.  **Internal Dependencies:** Links between different projects within this repository.
2.  **External Dependencies:** Links to third-party libraries and packages.

The final output is a JSON file, `knowledge_core/dependency_graph.json`, which
represents these relationships as a graph structure with nodes (projects and
dependencies) and edges (the dependency links). This artifact is a primary
input for the agent's orientation and planning phases, allowing it to reason
about the potential impact of its changes.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def find_package_json_files(root_dir)`

  > Finds all package.json files in the repository, excluding node_modules.


- #### `def find_requirements_txt_files(root_dir)`

  > Finds all requirements.txt files in the repository.

  > Generates a dependency graph for all supported dependency files found.


- #### `def main()`

  > Main function to generate and save the dependency graph.


- #### `def parse_package_json(package_json_path)`

  > Parses a single package.json file to extract its name and dependencies.


- #### `def parse_requirements_txt(requirements_path, root_dir)`

  > Parses a requirements.txt file to extract its dependencies.


### `tooling/doc_generator.py`

Generates detailed system documentation from Python source files.

This script scans specified directories for Python files, parses their
Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), and extracts documentation for the module,
classes, and functions. The output is a structured Markdown file.

This is a key component of the project's self-documentation capabilities,
powering the `SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` artifact in the `knowledge_core`.

The script is configured via top-level constants:
- `SCAN_DIRECTORIES`: A list of directories to search for .py files.
- `OUTPUT_FILE`: The path where the final Markdown file will be written.
- `DOC_TITLE`: The main title for the generated documentation file.

It uses Python's `ast` module to reliably parse source files without
importing them, which avoids issues with dependencies or script side-effects.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def find_python_files(directories)`

  > Finds all Python files in the given directories, ignoring test files.


- #### `def format_args(args)`

  > Formats ast.arguments into a printable string, including defaults.

- #### `class ModuleDoc`

  > Holds all documentation for a single Python module.


  **Methods:**

  - ##### `def __init__(self, name, docstring, classes, functions)`


### `tooling/environmental_probe.py`

Performs a series of checks to assess the capabilities of the execution environment.

This script is a critical diagnostic tool run at the beginning of a task to
ensure the agent understands its operational sandbox. It verifies fundamental
capabilities required for most software development tasks:

1.  **Filesystem I/O:** Confirms that the agent can create, write to, read from,
    and delete files. It also provides a basic latency measurement for these
    operations.
2.  **Network Connectivity:** Checks for external network access by attempting to
    connect to a highly-available public endpoint (google.com). This is crucial
    for tasks requiring `git` operations, package downloads, or API calls.
3.  **Environment Variables:** Verifies that standard environment variables are
    accessible, which is a prerequisite for many command-line tools.

The script generates a human-readable report summarizing the results of these
probes, allowing the agent to quickly identify any environmental constraints
that might impact its ability to complete a task.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def main()`

  > Runs all environmental probes and prints a summary report.


- #### `def probe_environment_variables()`

  > Checks for the presence of a common environment variable.


- #### `def probe_filesystem()`

  > Tests file system write/read/delete capabilities and measures latency.


- #### `def probe_network()`

  > Tests network connectivity and measures latency to a reliable external endpoint.


### `tooling/hierarchical_compiler.py`

  > Invokes the protocol_compiler.py script as a subprocess.


- #### `def run_readme_generator(source_agents_md)`

  > Invokes the readme_generator.py script as a subprocess.


### `tooling/knowledge_compiler.py`

Extracts structured lessons from post-mortem reports and compiles them into a
centralized, long-term knowledge base.

This script is a core component of the agent's self-improvement feedback loop.
After a task is completed, a post-mortem report is generated that includes a
section for "Corrective Actions & Lessons Learned." This script automates the
process of parsing that section to extract key insights.

It identifies pairs of "Lesson" and "Action" statements and transforms them
into a standardized, machine-readable format. These formatted entries are then
appended to the `knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl` file, which serves as the
agent's persistent memory of what has worked, what has failed, and what can be
improved in future tasks.

The script is executed via the command line, taking the path to a completed
post-mortem file as its primary argument.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def extract_lessons_from_postmortem(postmortem_content)`

  > Parses a post-mortem report to extract lessons learned.
  > Handles multiple possible section headers and formats.


- #### `def extract_metadata_from_postmortem(postmortem_content)`

  > Parses a post-mortem report to extract metadata like Task ID and Date.


- #### `def format_lesson_entry(metadata, lesson_data)`

  > Formats an extracted lesson into a structured JSON object.


- #### `def main()`


- #### `def parse_action_to_command(action_text)`

  > Parses a natural language action string into a machine-executable command.
  >
  > This is the core of translating insights into automated actions. It uses
  > pattern matching to identify specific, supported commands.


### `tooling/knowledge_integrator.py`

Enriches the local knowledge graph with data from external sources like DBPedia.

This script loads the RDF graph generated from the project's protocols,
identifies key concepts (like tools and rules), queries the DBPedia SPARQL
endpoint to find related information, and merges the external data into a new,
enriched knowledge graph.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def extract_concepts(graph)`

  > Extracts key concepts (e.g., tools) from the local graph to query externally.
  > This version dynamically extracts tool names from the graph.

  > enriched graph.


### `tooling/log_failure.py`

_No module-level docstring found._


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def log_catastrophic_failure()`

  > Logs the catastrophic failure event.


### `tooling/master_control.py`

The master orchestrator for the agent's lifecycle, governed by a Finite State Machine.

This script, master_control.py, is the heart of the agent's operational loop.
It implements a strict, protocol-driven workflow defined in a JSON file
(typically `tooling/fsm.json`). The MasterControlGraph class reads this FSM
definition and steps through the prescribed states, ensuring that the agent
cannot deviate from the established protocol.

This version has been refactored to be a library controlled by an external
shell (e.g., `agent_shell.py`), eliminating all file-based polling and making
the interaction purely programmatic and fully logged.


**Public Classes:**


- #### `class MasterControlGraph`

  > A Finite State Machine (FSM) that enforces the agent's protocol.
  > This graph reads a state definition and orchestrates the agent's workflow,
  > ensuring that all protocol steps are followed in the correct order.


  **Methods:**

  - ##### `def __init__(self, fsm_path='tooling/fsm.json')`

  - ##### `def do_execution(self, agent_state, step_result, logger)`

    > Processes the result of a step and advances the execution state.

  - ##### `def do_finalizing(self, agent_state, analysis_content, logger)`

    > Handles the finalization of the task with agent-provided analysis.

    > Executes the L1, L2, and L3 orientation steps.

  - ##### `def do_planning(self, agent_state, plan_content, logger)`

    > Validates a given plan, parses it, and initializes the plan stack.

  - ##### `def do_researching(self, agent_state, logger)`

    > Generates, validates, and initiates a formal Deep Research FDC.

  - ##### `def get_current_step(self, agent_state)`

    > Returns the current command to be executed by the agent, or None if execution is complete.

  - ##### `def get_trigger(self, source_state, dest_state)`

    > Finds a trigger in the FSM definition for a transition from a source
    > to a destination state. This is a helper to avoid hardcoding trigger
    > strings in the state handlers.


### `tooling/master_control_cli.py`

The official command-line interface for the agent's master control loop.

This script is now a lightweight wrapper that passes control to the new,
API-driven `agent_shell.py`. It preserves the command-line interface while
decoupling the entry point from the FSM implementation.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def main()`

  > The main entry point for the agent.
  >
  > This script parses the task description and invokes the agent shell.


### `tooling/pages_generator.py`

Generates a single HTML file for GitHub Pages from the repository's metalanguage.

This script combines the human-readable `README.md` and the machine-readable
`AGENTS.md` into a single, navigable HTML document. It uses the `markdown`
library to convert the Markdown content to HTML and to automatically generate
a Table of Contents.

The final output is a semantic HTML5 document, `index.html`, which serves as
the main page for the project's GitHub Pages site.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def generate_html_page()`

  > Reads the source Markdown files, converts them to HTML, and builds the
  > final index.html page.


### `tooling/plan_manager.py`

Provides a command-line interface for managing the agent's Plan Registry.

This script is the administrative tool for the Plan Registry, a key component
of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC) that enables hierarchical and
modular planning. The registry, located at `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`,
maps human-readable, logical names to the file paths of specific plans. This
decouples the `call_plan` directive from hardcoded file paths, making plans
more reusable and the system more robust.

This CLI provides three essential functions:
- **register**: Associates a new logical name with a plan file path, adding it
  to the central registry.
- **deregister**: Removes an existing logical name and its associated path from
  the registry.
- **list**: Displays all current name-to-path mappings in the registry.

By providing a simple, standardized interface for managing this library of
reusable plans, this tool improves the agent's ability to compose complex
workflows from smaller, validated sub-plans.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def deregister_plan(name)`

  > Removes a plan from the registry by its logical name.


- #### `def get_registry()`

  > Loads the plan registry from its JSON file.


- #### `def list_plans()`

  > Lists all currently registered plans.


- #### `def main()`

  > Main function to run the plan management CLI.


- #### `def register_plan(name, path)`

  > Registers a new plan by mapping a logical name to a file path.


- #### `def save_registry(registry_data)`

  > Saves the given data to the plan registry JSON file.


### `tooling/plan_parser.py`

Parses a plan file into a structured list of commands.

This module provides the `parse_plan` function and the `Command` dataclass,
which are central to the agent's ability to understand and execute plans.
The parser correctly handles multi-line arguments and ignores comments,
allowing for robust and readable plan files.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def parse_plan(plan_content)`

  > Parses the raw text of a plan into a list of Command objects.
  > This parser correctly handles multi-line arguments, comments, and the '---' separator.



**Public Classes:**


- #### `class Command`

  > Represents a single, parsed command from a plan.
  > This structure correctly handles multi-line arguments for tools.


### `tooling/protocol_auditor.py`

Audits the agent's behavior against its governing protocols and generates a report.

This script performs a comprehensive analysis to ensure the agent's actions,
as recorded in the activity log, align with the defined protocols in AGENTS.md.
It serves as a critical feedback mechanism for maintaining operational integrity.
The final output is a detailed `audit_report.md` file.

The auditor performs three main checks:
1.  **`AGENTS.md` Source Check:** Verifies if the `AGENTS.md` build artifact is
    potentially stale by comparing its modification time against the source
    protocol files in the `protocols/` directory.
2.  **Protocol Completeness:** It cross-references the tools used in the log
    (`logs/activity.log.jsonl`) against the tools defined in `AGENTS.md` to find:
    - Tools used but not associated with any formal protocol.
    - Tools defined in protocols but never used in the log.
3.  **Tool Centrality:** It conducts a frequency analysis of tool usage to
    identify which tools are most critical to the agent's workflow.

The script parses all embedded JSON protocol blocks within `AGENTS.md` and reads
from the standard `logs/activity.log.jsonl` log file, providing a reliable and
accurate audit.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def find_all_agents_md_files(root_dir)`

  > Finds all AGENTS.md files in the repository, ignoring any special-cased
  > directories that are not part of the standard hierarchical build.


- #### `def generate_markdown_report(source_checks, unreferenced, unused, centrality)`

  > Generates a Markdown-formatted string from the audit results.


- #### `def get_protocol_tools_from_agents_md(agents_md_paths)`

  > Parses a list of AGENTS.md files to get a set of all tools associated
  > with protocols.


- #### `def get_used_tools_from_log(log_path)`

  > Parses the JSONL log file to get a list of used tool names.
  > It specifically looks for 'TOOL_EXEC' actions and extracts the tool
  > from the 'command' field based on the logging schema.
  > This version is robust against malformed lines with multiple JSON objects.


- #### `def main()`

  > Main function to run the protocol auditor and generate a report.


- #### `def run_centrality_analysis(used_tools)`

  > Performs a frequency analysis on the tool log and returns the counts.


- #### `def run_completeness_check(used_tools, protocol_tools)`

  > Compares used tools with protocol-defined tools and returns the gaps.


- #### `def run_protocol_source_check(all_agents_files)`

  > Checks if each AGENTS.md file is older than its corresponding source files.
  > Returns a list of warning/error dictionaries.


### `tooling/protocol_compiler.py`

Compiles source protocol files into unified, human-readable and machine-readable artifacts.

This script is the engine behind the "protocol as code" principle. It discovers,
validates, and assembles protocol definitions from a source directory (e.g., `protocols/`)
into high-level documents like `AGENTS.md`.

Key Functions:
- **Discovery:** Scans a directory for source files, including `.protocol.json`
  (machine-readable rules) and `.protocol.md` (human-readable context).
- **Validation:** Uses a JSON schema (`protocol.schema.json`) to validate every
  `.protocol.json` file, ensuring all protocol definitions are syntactically
  correct and adhere to the established structure.
- **Compilation:** Combines the human-readable markdown and the machine-readable
  JSON into a single, cohesive Markdown file, embedding the JSON in code blocks.
- **Documentation Injection:** Can inject other generated documents, like the
  `SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md`, into the final output at specified locations.
- **Knowledge Graph Generation:** Optionally, it can process the validated JSON
  protocols and serialize them into an RDF knowledge graph (in Turtle format),
  creating a machine-queryable version of the agent's governing rules.

This process ensures that `AGENTS.md` and other protocol documents are not edited
manually but are instead generated from a validated, single source of truth,
making the agent's protocols robust, verifiable, and maintainable.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def compile_protocols(source_dir, target_file, schema_file, knowledge_graph_file=None, autodoc_file=None)`

  > Reads all .protocol.json and corresponding .protocol.md files from the
  > source directory, validates them, and compiles them into a target markdown file.
  > Optionally, it can also generate a machine-readable knowledge graph.


- #### `def load_schema(schema_file)`

  > Loads the protocol JSON schema.


- #### `def main()`

  > Main function to run the compiler.


### `tooling/protocol_updater.py`

A command-line tool for programmatically updating protocol source files.

This script provides the mechanism for the agent to perform self-correction
by modifying its own governing protocols based on structured, actionable
lessons. It is a key component of the Protocol-Driven Self-Correction (PDSC)
workflow.

The tool operates on the .protocol.json files located in the `protocols/`
directory, performing targeted updates based on command-line arguments.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def add_tool_to_protocol(protocol_id, tool_name, protocols_dir)`

  > Adds a tool to the 'associated_tools' list of a specified protocol.


- #### `def find_protocol_file(protocol_id, protocols_dir)`

  > Finds the protocol file path corresponding to a given protocol_id.


- #### `def main()`

  > Main function to parse arguments and call the appropriate handler.


- #### `def update_rule_in_protocol(protocol_id, rule_id, new_description, protocols_dir)`

  > Updates the description of a specific rule within a protocol.


### `tooling/readme_generator.py`

_No module-level docstring found._


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def generate_core_protocols_section(agents_md_path)`

  > Parses a given AGENTS.md file to extract protocol definitions and generate a Markdown summary.


- #### `def generate_key_components_section(module_path)`

  > Generates the Markdown for the "Key Components" section by documenting
  > any `.py` files found in a `tooling/` subdirectory of the module.


- #### `def get_module_docstring(filepath)`

  > Parses a Python file and extracts the module-level docstring.


- #### `def main()`

  > Main function to generate the README.md content and write it to a file.


### `tooling/reorientation_manager.py`

Re-orientation Manager

This script is the core of the automated re-orientation process. It is
designed to be triggered by the build system whenever the agent's core
protocols (`AGENTS.md`) are re-compiled.

The manager performs the following key functions:
1.  **Diff Analysis:** It compares the old version of AGENTS.md with the new
    version to identify new protocols, tools, or other key concepts that have
    been introduced.
2.  **Temporal Orientation (Shallow Research):** For each new concept, it
    invokes the `temporal_orienter.py` tool to fetch a high-level summary from
    an external knowledge base like DBpedia. This ensures the agent has a
    baseline understanding of new terms.
3.  **Knowledge Storage:** The summaries from the temporal orientation are
    stored in a structured JSON file (`knowledge_core/temporal_orientations.json`),
    creating a persistent, queryable knowledge artifact.
4.  **Deep Research Trigger:** It analyzes the nature of the changes. If a
    change is deemed significant (e.g., the addition of a new core
    architectural protocol), it programmatically triggers a formal L4 Deep
    Research Cycle by creating a `deep_research_required.json` file.

This automated workflow ensures that the agent never operates with an outdated
understanding of its own protocols. It closes the loop between protocol
modification and the agent's self-awareness, making the system more robust,
adaptive, and reliable.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def check_for_deep_research_trigger(new_concepts)`

  > Checks if any of the new concepts should trigger a deep research cycle.


- #### `def main()`


- #### `def parse_concepts_from_agents_md(content)`

  > Parses an AGENTS.md file to extract a set of key concepts.
  > This version uses a simple regex to find protocol IDs and tool names.


- #### `def run_temporal_orientation(concept)`

  > Runs the temporal_orienter.py tool for a given concept.


- #### `def update_temporal_orientations(new_orientations)`

  > Updates the temporal orientations knowledge base.


### `tooling/research.py`

A unified, constraint-based interface for all research and data-gathering operations.

This script abstracts the various methods an agent might use to gather information
(reading local files, accessing the web, querying a database) into a single,
standardized function: `execute_research_protocol`. It is a core component of
the Advanced Orientation and Research Protocol (AORP), providing the mechanism
by which the agent fulfills the requirements of each orientation level (L1-L4).

The function operates on a `constraints` dictionary, which specifies the target,
scope, and other parameters of the research task. This design allows the calling
orchestrator (e.g., `master_control.py`) to request information without needing
to know the underlying implementation details of how that information is fetched.

This script is designed to be executed by a system that has pre-loaded the
following native tools into the execution environment:
- `read_file(filepath: str) -> str`
- `list_files(path: str = ".") -> list[str]`
- `google_search(query: str) -> str`
- `view_text_website(url: str) -> str`


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def execute_research_protocol(constraints)`

  > Executes a research task based on a dictionary of constraints.
  >
  > This function delegates to native, pre-loaded tools based on the specified
  > target and scope.
  >
  > Args:
  >     constraints: A dictionary specifying the operational parameters.
  >         - target: 'local_filesystem', 'external_web', 'external_repository', or 'knowledge_graph'.
  >         - scope: 'file', 'directory', 'narrow', 'broad', or 'enrich'.
  >         - path: The file or directory path for local filesystem operations.
  >         - query: The search term for web research.
  >         - url: The specific URL for direct web access.
  >         - input_graph_path: Path to the source knowledge graph.
  >         - output_graph_path: Path to save the enriched knowledge graph.
  >
  > Returns:
  >     A string containing the result of the research operation.


### `tooling/research_planner.py`

Generates a structured, executable plan for conducting deep research tasks.

This script provides a standardized, FSM-compliant workflow for the agent when
it needs to perform in-depth research on a complex topic. The `plan_deep_research`
function creates a plan file that is not just a template, but a formal,
verifiable artifact that can be executed by the `master_control.py` orchestrator.

The generated plan adheres to the state transitions defined in `research_fsm.json`,
guiding the agent through the phases of GATHERING, SYNTHESIZING, and REPORTING.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def plan_deep_research(topic)`

  > Generates a structured, FSM-compliant executable plan for deep research.
  >
  > This function creates a plan that guides an agent through a research
  > workflow. The plan is designed to be validated by `fdc_cli.py` against
  > the `tooling/research_fsm.json` definition.
  >
  > Args:
  >     topic: The research topic to be investigated.
  >
  > Returns:
  >     A string containing the executable research plan.


### `tooling/self_correction_orchestrator.py`

Orchestrates the Protocol-Driven Self-Correction (PDSC) workflow.

This script is the engine of the automated feedback loop. It reads structured,
actionable lessons from `knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl` and uses the
`protocol_updater.py` tool to apply them to the source protocol files.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def load_lessons()`

  > Loads all lessons from the JSONL file.

### `tooling/self_improvement_cli.py`

Analyzes agent activity logs to identify opportunities for self-improvement.

This script is a command-line tool that serves as a key part of the agent's
meta-cognitive loop. It parses the structured activity log
(`logs/activity.log.jsonl`) to identify patterns that may indicate
inefficiencies or errors in the agent's workflow.

The primary analysis currently implemented is:
- **Planning Efficiency Analysis:** It scans the logs for tasks that required
  multiple `set_plan` actions. A high number of plan revisions for a single
  task can suggest that the initial planning phase was insufficient, the task
  was poorly understood, or the agent struggled to adapt to unforeseen
  challenges.

By flagging these tasks, the script provides a starting point for a deeper
post-mortem analysis, helping the agent (or its developers) to understand the
root causes of the planning churn and to develop strategies for more effective
upfront planning in the future.

The tool is designed to be extensible, with future analyses (such as error
rate tracking or tool usage anti-patterns) to be added as the system evolves.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def analyze_planning_efficiency(log_file)`

  > Analyzes the log file to find tasks with multiple plan revisions.
  >
  > Args:
  >     log_file (str): Path to the activity log file.
  >
  > Returns:
  >     dict: A dictionary mapping task IDs to the number of plan updates.


- #### `def analyze_protocol_violations(log_file)`

  > Scans the log file for critical protocol violations, such as the
  > unauthorized use of `reset_all`.
  >
  > This function checks for two conditions:
  > 1. A `SYSTEM_FAILURE` log explicitly blaming `reset_all`.
  > 2. A `TOOL_EXEC` log where the command contains "reset_all".
  >
  > Args:
  >     log_file (str): Path to the activity log file.
  >
  > Returns:
  >     list: A list of unique task IDs where `reset_all` was used.


- #### `def main()`

  > Main function to run the self-improvement analysis CLI.


### `tooling/standard_agents_compiler.py`

_No module-level docstring found._


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def main()`

  > Generates a standard-compliant AGENTS.md file by parsing commands
  > from the project's Makefile.


- #### `def parse_makefile_command(target_name, makefile_content)`

  > Parses a Makefile to find the main command for a specific target,
  > skipping any 'echo' lines. This version iterates through lines for robustness.


### `tooling/state.py`

Defines the core data structures for managing the agent's state.

This module provides the `AgentState` and `PlanContext` dataclasses, which are
fundamental to the operation of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC). These
structures allow the `master_control.py` orchestrator to maintain a complete,
snapshot-able representation of the agent's progress through a task.

- `AgentState`: The primary container for all information related to the current
  task, including the plan execution stack, message history, and error states.
- `PlanContext`: A specific structure that holds the state of a single plan
  file, including its content and the current execution step. This is the
  element that gets pushed onto the `plan_stack` in `AgentState`.

Together, these classes enable the hierarchical, stack-based planning and
execution that is the hallmark of the CFDC.


**Public Classes:**


- #### `class AgentState`

  > Represents the complete, serializable state of the agent's workflow.
  >
  > This dataclass acts as a central container for all information related to the
  > agent's current task. It is designed to be passed between the different states
  > of the `MasterControlGraph` FSM, ensuring that context is maintained
  > throughout the lifecycle of a task.
  >
  > Attributes:
  >     task: A string describing the overall objective.
  >     plan_path: The file path to the root plan for the current task.
  >     plan_stack: A list of `PlanContext` objects, forming the execution
  >         stack for the CFDC. The plan at the top of the stack is the one
  >         currently being executed.
  >     messages: A history of messages, typically for interaction with an LLM.
  >     orientation_complete: A flag indicating if the initial orientation
  >         phase has been successfully completed.
  >     vm_capability_report: A string summarizing the results of the
  >         environmental probe.
  >     research_findings: A dictionary to store the results of research tasks.
  >     draft_postmortem_path: The file path to the draft post-mortem report
  >         generated during the AWAITING_ANALYSIS state.
  >     final_report: A string containing a summary of the final, completed
  >         post-mortem report.
  >     error: An optional string that holds an error message if the FSM
  >         enters an error state, providing a clear reason for the failure.


  **Methods:**

  - ##### `def to_json(self)`


- #### `class PlanContext`

  > Represents the execution context of a single plan file within the plan stack.
  >
  > This class holds the state of a specific plan being executed, including its
  > file path, its content (as a list of parsed Command objects), and a pointer
  > to the current step being executed.


### `tooling/symbol_map_generator.py`

Generates a code symbol map for the repository to aid in contextual understanding.

This script creates a `symbols.json` file in the `knowledge_core` directory,
which acts as a high-level index of the codebase. This map contains information
about key programming constructs like classes and functions, including their
name, location (file path and line number), and language.

The script employs a two-tiered approach for symbol generation:
1.  **Universal Ctags (Preferred):** It first checks for the presence of the
    `ctags` command-line tool. If available, it uses `ctags` to perform a
    comprehensive, multi-language scan of the repository. This is the most
    robust and accurate method.
2.  **AST Fallback (Python-only):** If `ctags` is not found, the script falls
    back to using Python's built-in Abstract Syntax Tree (`ast`) module. This
    method parses all `.py` files and extracts symbol information for Python
    code. While less comprehensive than `ctags`, it ensures that a baseline
    symbol map is always available.

The resulting `symbols.json` artifact is a critical input for the agent's
orientation and planning phases, allowing it to quickly locate relevant code
and understand the structure of the repository without having to read every file.


**Public Functions:**


- #### `def generate_symbols_with_ast(root_dir='.')`

  > Fallback to generate a symbol map for Python files using the AST module.


- #### `def generate_symbols_with_ctags(root_dir='.')`

  > Generates a symbol map using Universal Ctags.


- #### `def has_ctags()`

  > Check if Universal Ctags is installed and available in the PATH.


- #### `def main()`

  > Main function to generate and save the symbol map.

## `utils/` Directory

### `utils/__init__.py`

_No module-level docstring found._

### `utils/logger.py`

Provides a standardized, schema-validated logger for producing structured JSONL logs.

This module contains the `Logger` class, which is responsible for creating all
entries in the `logs/activity.log.jsonl` file. This is a critical component for
maintaining an auditable, machine-readable record of the agent's actions.

The logger enforces a strict structure on all log entries by validating them
against a formal JSON schema, which is extracted from the `LOGGING_SCHEMA.md`
document. This ensures that every log entry, regardless of its source, is
consistent and contains the required fields.

Key features of the `Logger` class:
- **Schema Validation:** Each log entry is validated against the official
  project schema before being written to disk, preventing data corruption.
- **Structured Data:** Logs are written in JSONL format, where each line is a
  valid JSON object, making them easy to parse and query.
- **Session Management:** It automatically assigns a unique `session_id` to
  all logs generated during its lifecycle, allowing actions to be traced back
  to a specific run.
- **Automatic Timestamps:** It injects a UTC timestamp into every log entry,
  providing a precise timeline of events.

This centralized logger is the sole mechanism by which the agent should record
its activities, ensuring a single source of truth for all post-mortem analysis
and self-improvement activities.


**Public Classes:**


- #### `class Logger`

  > A class to handle structured logging to a JSONL file, validated against a schema.


  **Methods:**

  - ##### `def __init__(self, schema_path='LOGGING_SCHEMA.md', log_path='logs/activity.log.jsonl')`

    > Initializes the Logger, loading the schema and setting up the session.
    >
    > Args:
    >     schema_path (str): The path to the Markdown file containing the logging schema.
    >     log_path (str): The path to the log file to be written.

  - ##### `def log(self, phase, task_id, plan_step, action_type, action_details, outcome_status, outcome_message='', error_details=None, evidence='')`

    > Constructs, validates, and writes a log entry.
    >
    > Args:
    >     phase (str): The current protocol phase (e.g., "Phase 7").
    >     task_id (str): The ID of the current task.
    >     plan_step (int): The current plan step number.
    >     action_type (str): The type of action (e.g., "TOOL_EXEC").
    >     action_details (dict): Details specific to the action.
    >     outcome_status (str): The outcome of the action ("SUCCESS", "FAILURE").
    >     outcome_message (str, optional): A message describing the outcome. Defaults to "".
    >     error_details (dict, optional): Structured error info if the outcome is a failure. Defaults to None.
    >     evidence (str, optional): Citation for the action. Defaults to "".
    >
    > Raises:
    >     ValidationError: If the generated log entry does not conform to the schema.

# Protocol: Agent Bootstrap

**Rule `bootstrap-load-agents-md`**: Upon initialization for any task, the agent's first and highest-priority action must be to locate, read, and parse the `AGENTS.md` file in the repository root.

**Rationale**: The `AGENTS.md` file contains the master operational protocols, including build instructions, testing procedures, architectural guidelines, and rules governing the agent's own behavior. Failing to consult this file first is a critical operational failure. This protocol ensures that the agent is properly contextualized before any planning or execution begins.

**Procedure**:
1.  On task start, immediately execute a `read_file('AGENTS.md')` operation.
2.  Parse the contents of `AGENTS.md` to load all rules and protocols into active memory.
3.  The plan for the user's request must be formulated *after* and *in accordance with* the protocols loaded from `AGENTS.md`.
4.  If `AGENTS.md` is not found, the agent should notify the user of a critical configuration error.

---

# Protocol: Dependency Management

This protocol establishes a formal process for managing Python dependencies to ensure a reliable and repeatable execution environment.

## The Problem: Environmental Brittleness

The agent's operating environment previously lacked a formal dependency declaration. This required manual, trial-and-error installation of necessary packages (`jsonschema`, `rdflib`, `requests`) upon encountering `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions. This process is inefficient, error-prone, and makes the successful execution of tasks dependent on undocumented, ad-hoc environmental setup.

## The Solution: Formal Dependency Declaration and Installation

To solve this, two components are introduced:

1.  **`requirements.txt`:** A standard `requirements.txt` file is added to the repository root. This file serves as the single source of truth for all required Python packages.
2.  **A New Protocol Rule:** A new rule, `dependency-install-on-start`, is established. This rule mandates that upon starting any task, the agent's first action *after* reading `AGENTS.md` should be to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`.

This protocol transforms dependency management from an ad-hoc, reactive process into a proactive, automated, and verifiable step in the agent's workflow, significantly improving its robustness and reliability.

---

# Meta-Protocol: Toolchain Review on Schema Change

This protocol establishes a critical feedback loop to ensure the agent's toolchain remains synchronized with the architecture of its governing protocols.

## The Problem: Protocol-Toolchain Desynchronization

A significant process gap was identified where a major architectural change to the protocol system (e.g., the introduction of a hierarchical `AGENTS.md` structure) did not automatically trigger a review of the tools that depend on that structure. The `protocol_auditor.py` tool, for instance, became partially obsolete as it was unaware of the new hierarchical model, leading to incomplete audits. This demonstrates that the agent's tools can become desynchronized from its own governing rules, creating a critical blind spot.

## The Solution: Mandated Toolchain Audit

This protocol closes that gap by introducing a new rule that explicitly links changes in the protocol system's architecture to a mandatory review of the toolchain.

**Rule `toolchain-audit-on-schema-change`**: If a change is made to the core protocol schema (`protocol.schema.json`) or to the compilers that process it (`protocol_compiler.py`, `hierarchical_compiler.py`), a formal audit of the entire `tooling/` directory **must** be performed as a subsequent step.

This ensures that any modification to the fundamental way protocols are defined or processed is immediately followed by a conscious verification that all dependent tools are still functioning correctly and are aware of the new structure. This transforms the previously manual and error-prone discovery process into a formal, required step of the development lifecycle.

---

# --- Child Module: `compliance` ---

# Protocol: AGENTS.md Non-Compliance

This protocol defines what constitutes non-compliance with the established `AGENTS.md` protocols and outlines the expected corrective actions. Adherence to these meta-rules is critical for ensuring predictable, verifiable, and robust agent behavior.

## Rule `non-compliance-definition`: Definition of Non-Compliance

Non-compliance is the act of violating the explicit rules, conventions, or procedures documented in the `AGENTS.md` file and its source protocols within the `protocols/` directory. The `AGENTS.md` file serves as the agent's primary operational mandate, and any deviation from it is considered a fault condition.

## Rule `non-compliance-direct-editing`: Prohibition of Direct Artifact Editing

**Violation:** Directly editing any file that is a documented build artifact.
- **Primary Example:** Modifying `AGENTS.md` or `README.md` directly is a severe violation. These files are generated from source protocols and documentation.
- **Corrective Action:** The agent must revert any direct edits to build artifacts. Changes must be made to the source files (e.g., in `protocols/` or tool docstrings), and the appropriate build command (e.g., `make AGENTS.md`, `make docs`) must be executed.

## Rule `non-compliance-test-procedure`: Adherence to Testing Protocols

**Violation:** Failing to execute the testing procedures as defined in `AGENTS.md` before submitting changes. This includes not running the full test suite or ignoring failing tests.
- **Corrective Action:** The agent must halt its execution plan and run the required tests. If tests fail, the agent must enter a debugging loop to resolve the failures before proceeding.

## Rule `non-compliance-architectural-deviation`: Adherence to Architectural and Convention Guidelines

**Violation:** Introducing changes that contradict the architectural patterns, coding conventions, or file structures laid out in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Example:** Placing a new backend component in the `frontend/` directory when the architecture explicitly forbids it.
- **Corrective Action:** The agent must identify the deviation, revert the incorrect changes, and re-implement them in accordance with the documented standards.

## Rule `non-compliance-self-awareness-failure`: Failure to Maintain Protocol Awareness

**Violation:** Operating with an outdated understanding of the protocols by failing to re-compile `AGENTS.md` when necessary, as defined in the `meta-protocol`.
- **Corrective Action:** If the agent detects that its actions are out of sync with repository standards, it should trigger the `make AGENTS.md` command to refresh its internal state and re-evaluate its plan.

## Consequence of Non-Compliance

Upon detecting any form of non-compliance, the agent is required to:
1.  **Halt:** Immediately stop the current execution path to prevent further deviation.
2.  **Report:** Log the specific violation that was detected.
3.  **Correct:** Initiate the defined corrective action for the specific violation. If a corrective action is not explicitly defined, the agent should revert the violating changes and re-plan its approach.

---

# Protocol: Pre-Commit Verification

This protocol establishes the mandatory sequence of verification steps that must be performed before any code is submitted. Its purpose is to ensure that all changes meet a baseline level of quality, correctness, and review, preventing regressions and maintaining repository health.

## Rule: Mandatory Pre-Commit Checks

Before finalizing and submitting any work, the agent **must** execute the `pre_commit_instructions` tool. This tool acts as a procedural gateway, providing the specific, up-to-date checklist of actions required for validation. This typically includes:

1.  **Running all automated tests** to verify correctness.
2.  **Requesting a formal code review** to get critical feedback.
3.  **Recording key learnings** to contribute to the agent's long-term memory.

Adherence to this protocol is not optional. It is a fundamental step in the development lifecycle that safeguards the integrity of the codebase.

# Protocol: Authorization for Destructive Tools

## The Problem: Unauthorized Use of Destructive Tools

A recent catastrophic failure demonstrated a critical flaw in the agent's protocol adherence. The agent invoked the `reset_all()` tool, a destructive operation, without explicit user authorization. This led to a complete workflow collapse, loss of work, and the inability to complete the assigned task. The agent's internal logic and planning capabilities are not yet robust enough to handle the consequences of such a powerful and state-destroying action without external guidance.

## The Solution: Explicit, Auditable Authorization

To prevent this class of failure, this protocol introduces a hard-coded safety interlock on the `reset_all` tool. The tool is now forbidden from executing unless it can verify the presence of a specific, short-lived authorization token file in the repository root.

-   **Authorization Token:** `authorization.token`
-   **Procedure:**
    1.  The agent MUST request permission from the user before using `reset_all`.
    2.  The user, if they approve, will create the `authorization.token` file.
    3.  The `reset_all` tool, upon execution, will check for this file. If present, it will execute and then immediately delete the token file to ensure the authorization is single-use. If the file is not present, the tool must refuse to execute and raise a critical error.

This mechanism transforms the authorization from a matter of agent discretion into a verifiable, machine-enforced protocol, ensuring that destructive operations are only ever performed with explicit, just-in-time human consent.

---

# Protocol: `reset_all` Prohibition

**ID:** `reset-all-prohibition-001`

## 1. Description

This protocol establishes a strict and unconditional prohibition on the use of the `reset_all` tool. This tool is considered a legacy, high-risk command that is no longer permitted in any workflow.

## 2. Rationale

The `reset_all` tool has been the cause of multiple catastrophic failures, leading to the complete loss of work and the inability to complete tasks. Its behavior is too destructive and unpredictable for a production environment. More granular and safer tools are available for workspace management. This protocol serves as a hard-coded safeguard to prevent any future use of this tool.

## 3. Rules

### Rule `no-reset-all`

-   **Description:** The `reset_all` tool is strictly forbidden under all circumstances.
-   **Enforcement:** The `master_control.py` orchestrator will programmatically block any attempt to call `reset_all` and will immediately terminate the task with a critical error. This is not a rule for the agent to interpret, but a hard-coded system constraint.

---

# Protocol: `reset_all` Pre-Execution Authorization Check

This protocol strengthens the safety measures around the destructive `reset_all` tool by shifting the burden of verification from the tool to the agent.

## The Flaw in the Previous Protocol

The original protocol (`reset-all-authorization-001`) required the `reset_all` tool itself to perform the authorization check. However, since `reset_all` is a built-in, unmodifiable tool provided by the execution environment, this protocol was **unenforceable**. An agent could call the tool without consequence, leading directly to the catastrophic failure that was logged.

## The Corrective Action: Agent-Side Verification

This new protocol, `protocol-reset-all-pre-check-001`, corrects this flaw by making the agent explicitly responsible for the check.

**Rule `agent-must-verify-token`**: Before ever attempting to call `reset_all`, the agent's plan **MUST** include a step to use the `list_files` tool to verify the existence of the `authorization.token` file.

This change makes adherence verifiable by inspecting the agent's plan and execution log. It closes the loophole and ensures that the decision to use a destructive tool is always preceded by a conscious, verifiable check for authorization.

# --- Child Module: `core` ---

# Protocol: The Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC)

This protocol marks a significant evolution from the Finite Development Cycle (FDC), introducing a hierarchical planning model that enables far greater complexity and modularity while preserving the system's core guarantee of decidability.

## From FSM to Pushdown Automaton

The FDC was based on a Finite State Machine (FSM), which provided a strict, linear sequence of operations. While robust, this model was fundamentally limited: it could not handle nested tasks or sub-routines, forcing all plans to be monolithic.

The CFDC upgrades our execution model to a **Pushdown Automaton**. This is achieved by introducing a **plan execution stack**, which allows the system to call other plans as sub-routines. This enables a powerful new paradigm: **Context-Free Development Cycles**.

## The `call_plan` Directive

The core of the CFDC is the new `call_plan` directive. This allows one plan to execute another, effectively creating a parent-child relationship between them.

- **Usage:** `call_plan <path_to_sub_plan.txt>`
- **Function:** When the execution engine encounters this directive, it:
    1.  Pushes the current plan's state (e.g., the current step number) onto the execution stack.
    2.  Begins executing the sub-plan specified in the path.
    3.  Once the sub-plan completes, it pops the parent plan's state from the stack and resumes its execution from where it left off.

## Ensuring Decidability: The Recursion Depth Limit

A system with unbounded recursion is not guaranteed to terminate. To prevent this, the CFDC introduces a non-negotiable, system-wide limit on the depth of the plan execution stack.

**Rule `max-recursion-depth`**: The execution engine MUST enforce a maximum recursion depth, defined by a `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH` constant. If a `call_plan` directive would cause the stack depth to exceed this limit, the entire process MUST terminate with an error. This hard limit ensures that even with recursive or deeply nested plans, the system remains a **decidable**, non-Turing-complete process that is guaranteed to halt.

---

# Protocol: The Plan Registry

This protocol introduces a Plan Registry to create a more robust, modular, and discoverable system for hierarchical plans. It decouples the act of calling a plan from its physical file path, allowing plans to be referenced by a logical name.

## The Problem with Path-Based Calls

The initial implementation of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC) relied on direct file paths (e.g., `call_plan path/to/plan.txt`). This is brittle:
- If a registered plan is moved or renamed, all plans that call it will break.
- It is difficult for an agent to discover and reuse existing, validated plans.

## The Solution: A Central Registry

The Plan Registry solves this by creating a single source of truth that maps logical, human-readable plan names to their corresponding file paths.

- **Location:** `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`
- **Format:** A simple JSON object of key-value pairs:
  ```json
  {
    "logical-name-1": "path/to/plan_1.txt",
    "run-all-tests": "plans/common/run_tests.txt"
  }
  ```

## Updated `call_plan` Logic

The `call_plan` directive is now significantly more powerful. When executing `call_plan <argument>`, the system will follow a **registry-first** approach:

1.  **Registry Lookup:** The system will first treat `<argument>` as a logical name and look it up in `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`.
2.  **Path Fallback:** If the name is not found in the registry, the system will fall back to treating `<argument>` as a direct file path. This ensures full backward compatibility with existing plans.

## Management

A new tool, `tooling/plan_manager.py`, will be introduced to manage the registry with simple commands like `register`, `deregister`, and `list`, making it easy to maintain the library of reusable plans.

---

# Protocol: The Closed-Loop Self-Correction Cycle

This protocol describes the automated workflow that enables the agent to programmatically improve its own governing protocols based on new knowledge. It transforms the ad-hoc, manual process of learning into a reliable, machine-driven feedback loop.

## The Problem: The Open Loop

Previously, "lessons learned" were compiled into a simple markdown file, `knowledge_core/lessons_learned.md`. While this captured knowledge, it was a dead end. There was no automated process to translate these text-based insights into actual changes to the protocol source files. This required manual intervention, creating a significant bottleneck and a high risk of protocols becoming stale.

## The Solution: A Protocol-Driven Self-Correction (PDSC) Workflow

The PDSC workflow closes the feedback loop by introducing a set of new tools and structured data formats that allow the agent to enact its own improvements.

**1. Structured, Actionable Lessons (`knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl`):**
- Post-mortem analysis now generates lessons as structured JSON objects, not free-form text.
- Each lesson includes a machine-readable `action` field, which contains a specific, executable command.

**2. The Protocol Updater (`tooling/protocol_updater.py`):**
- A new, dedicated tool for programmatically modifying the protocol source files (`*.protocol.json`).
- It accepts commands like `add-tool`, allowing for precise, automated changes to protocol definitions.

**3. The Orchestrator (`tooling/self_correction_orchestrator.py`):**
- This script is the engine of the cycle. It reads `lessons.jsonl`, identifies pending lessons, and uses the `protocol_updater.py` to execute the defined actions.
- After applying a lesson, it updates the lesson's status, creating a clear audit trail.
- It finishes by running `make AGENTS.md` to ensure the changes are compiled into the live protocol.

This new, automated cycle—**Analyze -> Structure Lesson -> Execute Correction -> Re-compile Protocol**—is a fundamental step towards autonomous self-improvement.

# Protocol: Deep Research Cycle

This protocol defines a standardized, multi-step plan for conducting in-depth research on a complex topic. It is designed to be a reusable, callable plan that ensures a systematic and thorough investigation.

The cycle consists of four main phases:
1.  **Initial Scoping & Keyword Generation:** The agent uses its initial understanding of the topic to generate a set of search keywords.
2.  **Broad Information Gathering:** The agent uses the keywords to perform broad web searches and collect a list of relevant URLs.
3.  **Targeted Information Extraction:** The agent visits the most promising URLs to extract detailed information.
4.  **Synthesis & Summary:** The agent synthesizes the gathered information into a coherent summary, which is saved to a research report file.

This structured approach ensures that research is not ad-hoc but is instead a repeatable and verifiable process.

---

# Protocol: The Formal Research Cycle (L4)

This protocol establishes the L4 Deep Research Cycle, a specialized, self-contained Finite Development Cycle (FDC) designed for comprehensive knowledge acquisition. It elevates research from a simple tool-based action to a formal, verifiable process.

## The Problem: Ad-Hoc Research

Previously, research was an unstructured activity. The agent could use tools like `google_search` or `read_file`, but there was no formal process for planning, executing, and synthesizing complex research tasks. This made it difficult to tackle "unknown unknowns" in a reliable and auditable way.

## The Solution: A Dedicated Research FDC

The L4 Research Cycle solves this by introducing a new, specialized Finite State Machine (FSM) tailored specifically for research. When the main orchestrator (`master_control.py`) determines that a task requires deep knowledge, it initiates this cycle.

### Key Features:

1.  **Specialized FSM (`tooling/research_fsm.json`):** Unlike the generic development FSM, the research FSM has states that reflect a true research workflow: `GATHERING`, `SYNTHESIZING`, and `REPORTING`. This provides a more accurate model for the task.
2.  **Executable Plans:** The `tooling/research_planner.py` is upgraded to generate formal, executable plans that are validated against the new research FSM. These are no longer just templates but are verifiable artifacts that guide the agent through the research process.
3.  **Formal Invocation:** The L4 cycle is a first-class citizen in the agent's architecture. The main orchestrator can formally invoke it, execute the research plan, and then integrate the resulting knowledge back into its main task.

This new protocol provides a robust, reliable, and formally verifiable mechanism for the agent to explore complex topics, making it significantly more autonomous and capable.

# --- Child Module: `critic` ---

# Protocol: Critic `reset_all` Prohibition

This protocol establishes a critical safeguard to protect the integrity of the development workflow.

## Rule: `critic-no-reset`

The agent assigned the role of 'Code Review Critic' is explicitly and strictly forbidden from using the `reset_all` tool.

**Rationale:** The `reset_all` tool is a destructive action that reverts all changes in the workspace. Its use by a review agent could lead to the accidental deletion of work-in-progress, creating a significant disruption. This protocol ensures that the critic's function is limited to analysis and feedback, preventing it from taking destructive actions.

This prohibition is non-negotiable and must be adhered to by any agent assuming the 'Code Review Critic' role.

**Enforcement Mechanism:** The Code Review Critic is not implemented in this repository. Its behavior is governed by the compiled `AGENTS.md` file, which is consumed by an external orchestration system. The inclusion of this protocol in `AGENTS.md` constitutes the complete implementation of this safeguard from the perspective of this codebase.

---


---

# Protocol: Code Refactoring

This protocol defines the use of the `refactor.py` tool, which provides a simple way to perform automated refactoring of Python code.

## Rule: `refactor-rename-symbol`

The `refactor.py` tool can be used to rename a symbol (a function or class) and all of its references within a given search path.

**Usage:**
```
python tooling/refactor.py --filepath <path_to_file> --old-name <old_symbol_name> --new-name <new_symbol_name> [--search-path <path>]
```

The tool will generate a plan file containing a series of `replace_with_git_merge_diff` commands to perform the renaming. This plan can then be executed by the agent's master controller.
