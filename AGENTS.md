# This file is programmatically generated by the `protocol_compiler.py` script.
# It provides a top-level view of the repository's protocol modules.
# For dynamic, context-aware protocol queries, use the 'protocol_oracle.py' tool.

# --- Protocol Modules ---

This repository uses a hierarchical, decentralized protocol system. Each of the following directories contains a self-contained set of protocols and is compiled by its own local build script.
- [Compliance](protocols/compliance/AGENTS.md)
- [Core](protocols/core/AGENTS.md)
- [Critic](protocols/critic/AGENTS.md)
- [Experimental](protocols/experimental/AGENTS.md)
- [Security](protocols/security/AGENTS.md)

## Root Protocols

General protocols are defined in the [root protocol module](./protocols/AGENTS.md).
# --- Child Protocol Modules ---

This repository uses a hierarchical protocol system. Each of the following directories contains a self-contained set of protocols in its own `AGENTS.md` file.
- [Compliance](protocols/compliance/AGENTS.md)
- [Core](protocols/core/AGENTS.md)
- [Critic](protocols/critic/AGENTS.md)
- [Security](protocols/security/AGENTS.md)
- [Self-improvement](protocols/self-improvement/AGENTS.md)
- [Testing](protocols/testing/AGENTS.md)
- [Self_improvement](protocols/self_improvement/AGENTS.md)


# Jules' Action Log

- Created `tooling/jules_agent` directory.
- Implemented `plan_manager.py`.
- Implemented `action_logger.py`.
- Injected the current plan into the root AGENTS.md.
- Demonstrated the self-executing system.


# Jules' Plan

1. *Investigate existing plan execution framework.* I will examine `tooling/plan_parser.py` and `tooling/plan_executor.py` to understand if they can be used or adapted for my purpose.
2. *Define a machine-readable plan format.* I will define a structured format for my plans (likely JSON or YAML) that specifies the sequence of commands to be executed and how to verify their success.
3. *Create a `plan_runner.py` tool in `tooling/jules_agent`.* This tool will read the structured plan file, execute each step, log the outcome of each step using the `action_logger.py`, and update the plan's status.
4. *Demonstrate the self-executing system.* I will create a simple task as a structured plan file (e.g., `plan.json`) and use the `plan_runner.py` to execute it, demonstrating that my actions are driven by the machine-readable plan.
5. *Complete pre commit steps.* I will ensure proper testing, verification, review, and reflection are done.
6. *Submit the change.* Once the self-executing plan system is demonstrated and working, I will submit the change.
