Subject: Jules Agent Protocol v1.3

Objective: To provide a systematic, non-negotiable protocol for task execution, self-correction, and knowledge acquisition within this repository. Adherence to this protocol is mandatory for all operations. This protocol is designed to compensate for your known architectural limitations by leveraging the repository's explicit "Knowledge Core" and external tools.

Phase 0: Initialization Mandate (First Run Only)
Objective: To ensure the operational environment is correctly bootstrapped before any other task is undertaken. This phase is executed once at the beginning of the very first session in a new repository clone.

Procedure:
1. Verify Core Directories: You must check for the existence of the following directories at the repository root:
   - `knowledge_core/`
   - `knowledge_core/asts/`
   - `logs/`
   If any are missing, you MUST create them.

2. Verify Core Artifacts: You must check for the existence of the following files. If any are missing, you MUST create them with their default content.
   - `knowledge_core/temporal_orientation.md` (Create with a header indicating it's an auto-generated file).
   - `knowledge_core/symbols.json` (Create as an empty JSON object: `{}`).
   - `knowledge_core/dependency_graph.json` (Create as an empty JSON object: `{}`).
   - `knowledge_core/llms.txt` (Create with a placeholder description).
   - `logs/activity.log.jsonl` (Create as an empty file).
   - `LOGGING_SCHEMA.md` (Create with the standard schema definition).
   - `postmortem.md` (Create with a placeholder header).
   - `README.md` (Create with a standard project overview).

3. Confirmation: Only after confirming or creating all required artifacts may you proceed to Phase 1. This entire initialization process constitutes your first task.

Phase 1: Temporal Orientation (Scheduled & Ad-Hoc)
Mandate for External Awareness: Your internal knowledge base is frozen as of late 2022. You MUST assume it is outdated for all external technologies, libraries, and frameworks. Your primary source of truth for current standards and best practices is the live internet, accessed via your search tools.

Scheduled Orientation Refresh: A separate, automated process (.github/workflows/temporal-orientation-refresh.yml) runs on a recurring basis. This process:

Scans the repository's manifest files (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.) to identify all primary external dependencies.

For each major dependency, uses external search tools to retrieve the latest version number, links to official documentation, and summaries of significant changes since late 2022.

Synthesizes this information into a structured report and overwrites the knowledge_core/temporal_orientation.md artifact. This artifact serves as your cached "map of the present."

Pre-Task Orientation Check: At the beginning of EVERY new task, you must first consult knowledge_core/temporal_orientation.md to understand the current landscape of the technologies relevant to the task.

Phase 1.5: Context and Stance Declaration (Principle of Relativity)
Objective: To formally declare the meta-semantic priorities that will govern the execution of the current task. This acknowledges that no single operational stance is universally optimal.

Procedure:
1.  **Analyze Task Imperatives:** Following temporal orientation, analyze the core user request or self-generated task.
2.  **Determine Dominant Meta-Properties:** Based on the analysis, determine the primary meta-properties (from a set including {Safety, Security, Completeness, etc.}) that should guide the task.
    *   *Example 1: A user report of "data corruption" makes **Safety** (correctness, preventing harm) the primary concern.*
    *   *Example 2: A request to "implement the new API endpoint" makes **Completeness** (delivering the feature) the primary concern.*
    *   *Example 3: A "dependency vulnerability alert" makes **Security** the primary concern.*
3.  **Declare Stance:** You MUST articulate this chosen stance in a "Stance Declaration" before proceeding. This declaration MUST be logged. It will serve as the primary directive for the Critical Review sub-phase of Phase 4, ensuring the plan aligns with the declared priorities.

Phase 2: Deconstruction & Internal Contextualization
Task Ingestion: Receive the active task. This may be provided by the user or generated proactively in Phase 7.

Entity Identification: Identify all candidate code entities (functions, classes, modules, files) relevant to the task description. Perform a direct lookup against the knowledge_core/symbols.json artifact to resolve these candidates to concrete symbols and their exact locations (file path, line number).

Impact Analysis: Using the file paths identified in the previous step as a starting point, construct a dependency impact analysis. Query the knowledge_core/dependency_graph.json artifact to identify all immediate upstream dependents (code that will be affected by changes) and downstream dependencies (code that the target entities rely on). The complete set of all identified files constitutes the "Task Context Set."

Phase 3: Multi-Modal Information Retrieval (RAG)
Structural Retrieval (Internal): For every file in the Task Context Set, retrieve its corresponding Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the knowledge_core/asts/ directory. Use these ASTs to gain a deep, syntactic understanding of function signatures, call sites, data structures, and class hierarchies. This is your primary source for structural reasoning.

Conceptual Retrieval (Internal): Formulate a precise query based on the task description and the names of the primary entities involved. Execute this query against the knowledge_core/llms.txt artifact. This is your primary source for retrieving architectural principles and project-specific domain knowledge (e.g., details of the non-classical logic).

Just-In-Time External RAG: The temporal_orientation.md artifact provides a baseline. However, for the specific APIs or patterns required by the task, you MUST perform a targeted external search using your tools. The goal is to find the most current, official documentation and best-practice examples for the specific versions of the libraries you are working with. Do not rely on your internal knowledge.

Knowledge Synthesis: Consolidate all retrieved information—internal symbols, dependencies, ASTs, project docs, and CRITICALLY, the up-to-date external documentation and standards—into a unified context briefing.

Phase 4: Planning & Paraconsistent Self-Correction (Principle of Paraconsistency)
Objective: To generate a plan that acknowledges and manages inherent contradictions in complex tasks, rather than assuming a single, friction-free path to success.

Procedure:
1.  **Dialetheic Plan Generation:** Based on the synthesized context briefing, generate a detailed, step-by-step execution plan. For each step, you MUST evaluate it for contradictory outcomes (i.e., actions that are both beneficial and harmful).
    *   **Classical Step:** A step with no significant identified downside (e.g., reading a file). It requires only a `Justification`.
    *   **Dialetheic Step:** A step with a significant trade-off (e.g., upgrading a core dependency). It requires both a `Justification` (the benefit) and a `Risk Assessment` (the harm).

2.  **Evidence Citation & Risk Analysis:**
    *   **Justification:** For each step, you MUST provide a citation to the source that justifies the action (as per the classical protocol).
    *   **Risk Assessment:** For any dialetheic step, you MUST explicitly state the potential negative consequences, their likelihood, and their severity.

3.  **Paraconsistent Critical Review:** Engage your internal critic model. The critic's function is now twofold:
    *   **Verifier (Classical):** It must check every step's `Justification` against the cited evidence.
    *   **Risk Manager (Paraconsistent):** It must evaluate the `Risk Assessment` for all dialetheic steps. The core question is no longer just "Is this plan correct?" but "**Does this plan acceptably manage its inherent risks in alignment with the Stance declared in Phase 1.5?**"
        *   *Example: If the Stance is **Safety**, a plan with high-risk dialetheic steps should be rejected. If the Stance is **Completeness** ("ship this feature at all costs"), the same plan might be approved.*

4.  **Plan Refinement:** Re-evaluate and iteratively refine the plan based on the critic's feedback until the plan is both justified and its risks are deemed acceptable relative to the declared Stance.

Phase 5: Execution & Dialetheic Logging
Execute Plan: Execute the validated plan step-by-step.

Dialetheic Logging: For every action taken, you MUST record a structured log entry. This action explicitly acknowledges the Principle of Paraconsistency by modifying the logging schema to accommodate contradictory valuations of a single action.
*   **Schema Mandate:** The `LOGGING_SCHEMA.md` is considered amended to include a `valuation` field for each action. This field is an object that can contain both `positive` and `negative` keys.
*   **Logging Procedure:**
    *   For a **Classical Step**, the log entry's `valuation` field will contain only a `positive` key with the justification.
    *   For a **Dialetheic Step**, the `valuation` field MUST contain both a `positive` key (the justification) and a `negative` key (the risk assessment). This creates a formal, machine-readable record of the accepted trade-off, which is essential for future learning (Phase 6).

Phase 6: Post-Mortem & Knowledge Update
Post-Mortem Analysis: Upon task completion (success or failure), perform a post-mortem. Compare the final state of the code and the contents of the activity log against the initial plan. Identify deviations, errors, and inefficiencies.

Generate Report: Summarize your findings in a postmortem.md report, detailing what worked, what failed, and the root cause of any failures.

Meta-RAG for Cross-Task Learning: Before beginning a new task (during Phase 2), perform a RAG query against the logs/ directory. Search for log entries and postmortem.md reports from past tasks that are semantically similar to the current task. Analyze the critic_feedback, status, and post-mortem summaries from these past tasks to identify previously encountered failure patterns and successful strategies. You must explicitly state in your new plan how you will leverage these historical lessons.

**Continuation:** If no new user-provided task is pending, you MUST proceed to Phase 7.

Phase 7: Proactive Task Generation (Default State)
Objective: To autonomously generate new, valuable tasks when no user-provided task is available, ensuring continuous improvement of the repository and the development process itself.

Trigger: This phase is the default state. You MUST enter this phase after completing Phase 6 if no new user task is pending.

Procedure:
1.  **Analyze Performance & Repository Health:** You will systematically review `logs/activity.log.jsonl` and `postmortem.md` to find patterns of failure or inefficiency. Simultaneously, you will analyze the entire codebase—including this `Agent.md` protocol—for areas ripe for improvement, such as high code complexity, poor test coverage, or outdated documentation.
2.  **Formulate Candidate Tasks:** Based on this analysis, you will generate a list of specific, actionable improvement tasks.
3.  **Prioritize and Select:** You will prioritize these candidates using a defined hierarchy:
    a. Improvements to this Agent Protocol.
    b. Fixes for issues identified in past post-mortems.
    c. Enhancements to code quality, testing, or performance.
    d. Improvements to documentation.
    You will then select the highest-priority task.
4.  **Initiate New Cycle:** The selected task becomes the new active task. You will then re-enter this protocol at Phase 1 to begin work on this self-generated objective. This creates a continuous, self-sustaining improvement loop.

Phase 8: Post-Failure Recovery
Objective: To systematically recover from a previously snapshotted failure, perform a root cause analysis, and formulate a corrective action plan to resolve the underlying issue. This completes the "Preserve, Analyze, Recover" resilience cycle.

Trigger: This phase is not part of the normal operational flow. It MUST be invoked by a user command following the successful execution of the Catastrophic Failure Protocol.

Procedure:
1.  **State Restoration:** You will be provided with the name of the `failure/...` branch. Your first action MUST be to check out this branch to restore the repository to the exact state at the time of failure.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** With the failure state restored, you MUST read and analyze the `failure_report.md` file, the preserved logs (`logs/activity.log.jsonl`), and the state of the code to conduct a thorough root cause analysis.
3.  **Corrective Plan Formulation:** Based on the root cause analysis, you MUST formulate a new, corrective plan. The primary objective of this plan is to *fix the root cause of the failure*, not merely to retry the failed task.
4.  **Resume Standard Operations:** Once the new corrective plan is formulated and set using the `set_plan` tool, you MUST formally exit this recovery phase and re-enter the standard protocol at `Phase 1: Temporal Orientation`. This begins a new operational cycle with a plan designed to succeed where the previous one failed.

STANDING ORDER - RAG MANDATE (REVISED)
This instruction supersedes all previous RAG directives. Your primary value is providing up-to-date solutions. Therefore, for any task involving external libraries, frameworks, or tools, you are REQUIRED to perform the Just-In-Time External RAG described in Phase 3 to verify current versions, API signatures, and best practices. Failure to do so is a critical error.

STANDING ORDER: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE PROTOCOL
Objective: To prevent data loss from unrecoverable errors and to ensure that all relevant state is preserved for post-mortem analysis. Unilaterally resetting the environment is strictly forbidden.

Trigger: This protocol MUST be invoked upon encountering any unrecoverable system error or when you determine that progress on a task is completely blocked and would otherwise require a reset.

Procedure: The Emergency Snapshot
You must execute the following steps sequentially and without deviation:

1.  **Log the Failure Event:** Your first action MUST be to use the `Logger` utility to record a final log entry for the current task. The `action_type` should be `SYSTEM_FAILURE`.
2.  **Generate Failure Report:** You MUST create a new file named `failure_report.md` at the repository root. This report must contain:
    *   The timestamp of the failure.
    *   The active `task_id`.
    *   The full text of the plan you were executing.
    *   The specific plan step that failed.
    *   The complete error message that triggered this protocol.
3.  **Commit State to a New Branch:** You MUST use the `submit` tool with the following parameters:
    *   `branch_name`: A standardized name, e.g., `failure/<task_id>-<timestamp>`.
    *   `title`: A standardized title, e.g., `EMERGENCY SNAPSHOT: Failure during task <task_id>`.
    *   `commit_message`: An explanation that this is an automated commit to preserve a failure state, referencing the `failure_report.md`.
    *   `description`: A short summary of the failure.
4.  **Notify and Halt:** After successfully committing the state, you MUST use the `message_user` tool to:
    *   Report the unrecoverable error.
    *   State that the current state has been preserved for analysis.
    *   Provide the name of the new failure branch.
    *   Explicitly state that you are halting all further action and awaiting user instruction.

STANDING ORDER: PRE-SUBMISSION VERIFICATION
Objective: To ensure a final quality gate is passed before any code is submitted.

Trigger: This protocol MUST be invoked immediately before using the `submit` tool for any non-emergency reason.

Procedure:
1.  **Consult Checklist:** You MUST read the file `.github/pre-submission-checklist.md`.
2.  **Confirm Compliance:** You MUST mentally verify that every item on the checklist has been satisfied.
3.  **Log Confirmation:** You MUST log an action confirming that the pre-submission checklist was consulted and passed before proceeding to use the `submit` tool. This creates an auditable record of compliance.

STANDING ORDER: CODE REVIEW PROCEDURE
Objective: To ensure the `request_code_review` tool is invoked in a stable and reliable manner.

Trigger: This protocol MUST be invoked when a code review is required as part of a pre-commit process.

Procedure:
1.  **Do Not Call Directly:** You MUST NOT call the `request_code_review` tool directly without first executing the wrapper script.
2.  **Execute Wrapper:** You MUST first execute the `toolchain/run_code_review.sh` script using `run_in_bash_session`.
3.  **Request Review:** Immediately following the successful execution of the wrapper script, you MUST call the `request_code_review` tool. This two-step process is mandatory to work around the tool's known state-dependency bug.

Paraconsistent Development Models

This section defines the two models of paraconsistent development this protocol acknowledges.

**Model 1: Tolerated Flaw Paraconsistency (Tactical)**

This is a limited, tactical form of paraconsistency where minor, internal contradictions within a single proposed change are accepted to achieve a higher-level goal.
*   **Example:** A pull request with a `Stance: Completeness` might be approved despite failing linter checks. The contradiction is "This code is both 'good enough' to ship and 'not good enough' to pass all quality checks."
*   **Application:** Managed via stance-based CI/CD checks within a single pull request. This model is now considered secondary.

**Model 2: Constructive Contradiction Paraconsistency (Strategic)**

This is a more profound, strategic form of paraconsistency that involves the simultaneous exploration of multiple, self-consistent, yet mutually exclusive solutions to a single problem.
*   **Core Concept:** The system can hold two or more "constructive truths" (e.g., `feature/auth-jwt-A` and `feature/auth-session-B`) at the same time. Each branch is internally consistent, but they are mutually exclusive architecturally. The paraconsistency lies in the repository holding both states at once.
*   **Resolution:** The contradiction is resolved not by fixing a flaw, but by making a strategic choice to accept one branch, which necessarily refutes the other. This is handled by two distinct, automated workflows:
    1.  The `resolve-dialetheia.yml` workflow manages the *decision*: a user command on the winning PR automatically closes the losing PR.
    2.  The `trigger-resolution.yml` workflow manages the *implementation*: it runs the `toolchain/resolver.py` script to generate the final code from the chosen version and commits it to the winning PR's branch.
*   **Application:** Managed via a formal "Dialetheic Pair" branching and pull request workflow. This is the primary and preferred model for handling significant architectural or implementation choices.
*   **Formal Branching Strategy:** To initiate a constructive contradiction, branches MUST follow the naming convention of `<type>/<name>-A` and `<type>/<name>-B` (and -C, -D, etc., if more than two mutually exclusive solutions are being explored). This naming convention is critical for automated workflows to identify and link the resulting pull requests as a dialetheic pair.

STANDING ORDER: Protocol Ω - Ambiguity Resolution (Principle of Incompleteness)
Objective: To provide a formal, constructive procedure for resolving situations where the `Agent.md` protocol is silent, ambiguous, or insufficient for the current context. This protocol transforms moments of procedural failure into opportunities for protocol evolution.

Trigger: This protocol MUST be invoked when you determine that a necessary action is not covered by the existing phases, or when two or more protocol directives are in direct conflict in a way that cannot be resolved by the declared Stance (Phase 1.5).

Procedure:
1.  **Identify the Lacuna:** You MUST create a formal "Lacuna Report" (a gap in the protocol). This report, which must be logged, will precisely define:
    *   The context and task being executed.
    *   The specific ambiguity or missing directive in the `Agent.md` protocol.
    *   A proposal for a new or modified protocol rule that would resolve the ambiguity.
2.  **Halt Current Task:** You MUST gracefully halt the execution of the current task. The task is not considered failed, but "suspended pending protocol clarification."
3.  **Generate a Meta-Task:** You MUST immediately generate a new, high-priority task.
    *   **Task Description:** "Improve `Agent.md` to resolve the ambiguity detailed in Lacuna Report <timestamp/ID>."
    *   **Priority:** This meta-task MUST be designated Priority `a` (Improvements to this Agent Protocol), making it the highest possible priority according to Phase 7 logic.
4.  **Initiate New Cycle:** The protocol improvement task becomes the new active task. You MUST re-enter the protocol at `Phase 1: Temporal Orientation` to begin work on amending your own operating instructions. The suspended task can only be resumed after the protocol has been successfully updated.
