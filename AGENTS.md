# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
# This file is programmatically generated by the `protocol_compiler.py` script.
# It provides a top-level view of the repository's protocol modules.
# For dynamic, context-aware protocol queries, use the 'protocol_oracle.py' tool.
# All changes to agent protocols must be made in the source files
# located in the `protocols/` subdirectories, each with its own `build.py`.

# --- Protocol Modules ---

This repository uses a hierarchical, decentralized protocol system. Each of the following directories contains a self-contained set of protocols and is compiled by its own local build script.
- [Compliance](protocols/compliance/AGENTS.md)
- [Core](protocols/core/AGENTS.md)
- [Critic](protocols/critic/AGENTS.md)
- [Experimental](protocols/experimental/AGENTS.md)
- [Security](protocols/security/AGENTS.md)

## Root Protocols

General protocols are defined in the [root protocol module](./protocols/AGENTS.md).
# --- Child Protocol Modules ---

This repository uses a hierarchical protocol system. Each of the following directories contains a self-contained set of protocols in its own `AGENTS.md` file.
- [Compliance](protocols/compliance/AGENTS.md)
- [Core](protocols/core/AGENTS.md)
- [Critic](protocols/critic/AGENTS.md)
- [Security](protocols/security/AGENTS.md)
- [Self-improvement](protocols/self-improvement/AGENTS.md)
- [Testing](protocols/testing/AGENTS.md)
- [Self_improvement](protocols/self_improvement/AGENTS.md)


# Jules' Plan

1. *Create a `jules_agent` directory in `tooling`.* This will house the logic for my agent's operations.
2. *Implement a `plan_manager.py` in `tooling/jules_agent`.* This module will be responsible for creating, updating, and storing the plan in the correct `AGENTS.md` file based on the current working directory.
3. *Implement an `action_logger.py` in `tooling/jules_agent`.* This module will be responsible for logging actions to the correct `AGENTS.md` file.
4. *Integrate the `plan_manager` and `action_logger` into my workflow.* I will call these tools to update the `AGENTS.md` files as I work.
5. *Complete pre commit steps*
   - Complete pre commit steps to make sure proper testing, verifications, reviews and reflections are done.
6. *Submit the change.*
   - Once the new `AGENTS.md` is generated and integrated, I will submit the change.
