# --- Protocol Modules ---

This repository uses a hierarchical, decentralized protocol system. Each of the following directories contains a self-contained set of protocols and is compiled by its own local build script.
- [Compliance](protocols/compliance/AGENTS.md)
- [Core](protocols/core/AGENTS.md)
- [Critic](protocols/critic/AGENTS.md)
- [Experimental](protocols/experimental/AGENTS.md)
- [Security](protocols/security/AGENTS.md)

## Root Protocols

General protocols are defined in the [root protocol module](./protocols/AGENTS.md).
