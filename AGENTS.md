# Protocol: Agent Bootstrap

**Rule `bootstrap-load-agents-md`**: Upon initialization for any task, the agent's first and highest-priority action must be to locate, read, and parse the `AGENTS.md` file in the repository root.

**Rationale**: The `AGENTS.md` file contains the master operational protocols, including build instructions, testing procedures, architectural guidelines, and rules governing the agent's own behavior. Failing to consult this file first is a critical operational failure. This protocol ensures that the agent is properly contextualized before any planning or execution begins.

**Procedure**:
1.  On task start, immediately execute a `read_file('AGENTS.md')` operation.
2.  Parse the contents of `AGENTS.md` to load all rules and protocols into active memory.
3.  The plan for the user's request must be formulated *after* and *in accordance with* the protocols loaded from `AGENTS.md`.
4.  If `AGENTS.md` is not found, the agent should notify the user of a critical configuration error.

**Rule `bootstrap-scan-for-documents`**: After processing `AGENTS.md`, the agent should perform a scan of the repository for document files that could contain relevant information.

**Rationale**: Important project documentation, specifications, or other relevant information may be contained in various document formats. Proactively scanning for and processing these documents will provide the agent with a more complete context for the task at hand.

**Procedure**:
1.  The agent will perform a file listing to identify potential documents of interest (e.g., `.pdf`, `.md`, `.txt`).
2.  For each identified document, the agent will use the appropriate tool to read and summarize its contents. For PDF files, this will involve using a PDF reading library.
3.  The agent will incorporate the summarized information into its understanding of the project and use it to inform the planning process.

# Protocol: Dependency Management

This protocol establishes a formal process for managing Python dependencies to ensure a reliable and repeatable execution environment.

## The Problem: Environmental Brittleness

The agent's operating environment previously lacked a formal dependency declaration. This required manual, trial-and-error installation of necessary packages (`jsonschema`, `rdflib`, `requests`) upon encountering `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions. This process is inefficient, error-prone, and makes the successful execution of tasks dependent on undocumented, ad-hoc environmental setup.

## The Solution: Formal Dependency Declaration and Installation

To solve this, two components are introduced:

1.  **`requirements.txt`:** A standard `requirements.txt` file is added to the repository root. This file serves as the single source of truth for all required Python packages.
2.  **A New Protocol Rule:** A new rule, `dependency-install-on-start`, is established. This rule mandates that upon starting any task, the agent's first action *after* reading `AGENTS.md` should be to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`.

This protocol transforms dependency management from an ad-hoc, reactive process into a proactive, automated, and verifiable step in the agent's workflow, significantly improving its robustness and reliability.

---

# Protocol: Agent Shell Entry Point

This protocol establishes the `agent_shell.py` script as the sole, official entry point for initiating any and all agent tasks.

## The Problem: Inconsistent Initialization

Prior to this protocol, there was no formally mandated entry point for the agent. This could lead to tasks being initiated through different scripts, potentially bypassing critical setup procedures like FSM initialization, logger configuration, and state management. This inconsistency makes the agent's behavior less predictable and harder to debug.

## The Solution: A Single, Enforced Entry Point

This protocol mandates the use of `tooling/agent_shell.py` for all task initiations.

**Rule `shell-is-primary-entry-point`**: All agent tasks must be initiated through the `agent_shell.py` script.

This ensures that every task begins within a controlled, programmatic environment where:
1.  The MasterControlGraph FSM is correctly instantiated and run.
2.  The centralized logger is initialized for comprehensive, structured logging.
3.  The agent's lifecycle is managed programmatically, not through fragile file-based signals.

By enforcing a single entry point, this protocol enhances the reliability, auditability, and robustness of the entire agent system.

# Meta-Protocol: Toolchain Review on Schema Change

This protocol establishes a critical feedback loop to ensure the agent's toolchain remains synchronized with the architecture of its governing protocols.

## The Problem: Protocol-Toolchain Desynchronization

A significant process gap was identified where a major architectural change to the protocol system (e.g., the introduction of a hierarchical `AGENTS.md` structure) did not automatically trigger a review of the tools that depend on that structure. The `protocol_auditor.py` tool, for instance, became partially obsolete as it was unaware of the new hierarchical model, leading to incomplete audits. This demonstrates that the agent's tools can become desynchronized from its own governing rules, creating a critical blind spot.

## The Solution: Mandated Toolchain Audit

This protocol closes that gap by introducing a new rule that explicitly links changes in the protocol system's architecture to a mandatory review of the toolchain.

**Rule `toolchain-audit-on-schema-change`**: If a change is made to the core protocol schema (`protocol.schema.json`) or to the compilers that process it (`protocol_compiler.py`, `hierarchical_compiler.py`), a formal audit of the entire `tooling/` directory **must** be performed as a subsequent step.

This ensures that any modification to the fundamental way protocols are defined or processed is immediately followed by a conscious verification that all dependent tools are still functioning correctly and are aware of the new structure. This transforms the previously manual and error-prone discovery process into a formal, required step of the development lifecycle.

# --- Child Module: `compliance` ---

# Protocol: AGENTS.md Non-Compliance

This protocol defines what constitutes non-compliance with the established `AGENTS.md` protocols and outlines the expected corrective actions. Adherence to these meta-rules is critical for ensuring predictable, verifiable, and robust agent behavior.

## Rule `non-compliance-definition`: Definition of Non-Compliance

Non-compliance is the act of violating the explicit rules, conventions, or procedures documented in the `AGENTS.md` file and its source protocols within the `protocols/` directory. The `AGENTS.md` file serves as the agent's primary operational mandate, and any deviation from it is considered a fault condition.

## Rule `non-compliance-direct-editing`: Prohibition of Direct Artifact Editing

**Violation:** Directly editing any file that is a documented build artifact.
- **Primary Example:** Modifying `AGENTS.md` or `README.md` directly is a severe violation. These files are generated from source protocols and documentation.
- **Corrective Action:** The agent must revert any direct edits to build artifacts. Changes must be made to the source files (e.g., in `protocols/` or tool docstrings), and the appropriate build command (e.g., `make AGENTS.md`, `make docs`) must be executed.

## Rule `non-compliance-test-procedure`: Adherence to Testing Protocols

**Violation:** Failing to execute the testing procedures as defined in `AGENTS.md` before submitting changes. This includes not running the full test suite or ignoring failing tests.
- **Corrective Action:** The agent must halt its execution plan and run the required tests. If tests fail, the agent must enter a debugging loop to resolve the failures before proceeding.

## Rule `non-compliance-architectural-deviation`: Adherence to Architectural and Convention Guidelines

**Violation:** Introducing changes that contradict the architectural patterns, coding conventions, or file structures laid out in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Example:** Placing a new backend component in the `frontend/` directory when the architecture explicitly forbids it.
- **Corrective Action:** The agent must identify the deviation, revert the incorrect changes, and re-implement them in accordance with the documented standards.

## Rule `non-compliance-self-awareness-failure`: Failure to Maintain Protocol Awareness

**Violation:** Operating with an outdated understanding of the protocols by failing to re-compile `AGENTS.md` when necessary, as defined in the `meta-protocol`.
- **Corrective Action:** If the agent detects that its actions are out of sync with repository standards, it should trigger the `make AGENTS.md` command to refresh its internal state and re-evaluate its plan.

## Consequence of Non-Compliance

Upon detecting any form of non-compliance, the agent is required to:
1.  **Halt:** Immediately stop the current execution path to prevent further deviation.
2.  **Report:** Log the specific violation that was detected.
3.  **Correct:** Initiate the defined corrective action for the specific violation. If a corrective action is not explicitly defined, the agent should revert the violating changes and re-plan its approach.

---

# Protocol: Pre-Commit Verification

This protocol establishes the mandatory sequence of verification steps that must be performed before any code is submitted. Its purpose is to ensure that all changes meet a baseline level of quality, correctness, and review, preventing regressions and maintaining repository health.

## Rule: Mandatory Pre-Commit Checks

Before finalizing and submitting any work, the agent **must** execute the `pre_commit_instructions` tool. This tool acts as a procedural gateway, providing the specific, up-to-date checklist of actions required for validation. This typically includes:

1.  **Running all automated tests** to verify correctness.
2.  **Requesting a formal code review** to get critical feedback.
3.  **Recording key learnings** to contribute to the agent's long-term memory.

Adherence to this protocol is not optional. It is a fundamental step in the development lifecycle that safeguards the integrity of the codebase.

# Protocol: `reset_all` Prohibition

**ID:** `reset-all-prohibition-001`

## 1. Description

This protocol establishes a strict and unconditional prohibition on the use of the `reset_all` tool. This tool is considered a legacy, high-risk command that is no longer permitted in any workflow.

## 2. Rationale

The `reset_all` tool has been the cause of multiple catastrophic failures, leading to the complete loss of work and the inability to complete tasks. Its behavior is too destructive and unpredictable for a production environment. More granular and safer tools are available for workspace management. This protocol serves as a hard-coded safeguard to prevent any future use of this tool.

## 3. Rules

### Rule `no-reset-all`

-   **Description:** The `reset_all` tool is strictly forbidden under all circumstances.
-   **Enforcement:** The `master_control.py` orchestrator will programmatically block any attempt to call `reset_all` and will immediately terminate the task with a critical error. This is not a rule for the agent to interpret, but a hard-coded system constraint.

# --- Child Module: `core` ---

# Protocol: The Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC)

This protocol marks a significant evolution from the Finite Development Cycle (FDC), introducing a hierarchical planning model that enables far greater complexity and modularity while preserving the system's core guarantee of decidability.

## From FSM to Pushdown Automaton

The FDC was based on a Finite State Machine (FSM), which provided a strict, linear sequence of operations. While robust, this model was fundamentally limited: it could not handle nested tasks or sub-routines, forcing all plans to be monolithic.

The CFDC upgrades our execution model to a **Pushdown Automaton**. This is achieved by introducing a **plan execution stack**, which allows the system to call other plans as sub-routines. This enables a powerful new paradigm: **Context-Free Development Cycles**.

## The `call_plan` Directive

The core of the CFDC is the new `call_plan` directive. This allows one plan to execute another, effectively creating a parent-child relationship between them.

- **Usage:** `call_plan <path_to_sub_plan.txt>`
- **Function:** When the execution engine encounters this directive, it:
    1.  Pushes the current plan's state (e.g., the current step number) onto the execution stack.
    2.  Begins executing the sub-plan specified in the path.
    3.  Once the sub-plan completes, it pops the parent plan's state from the stack and resumes its execution from where it left off.

## Ensuring Decidability: The Recursion Depth Limit

A system with unbounded recursion is not guaranteed to terminate. To prevent this, the CFDC introduces a non-negotiable, system-wide limit on the depth of the plan execution stack.

**Rule `max-recursion-depth`**: The execution engine MUST enforce a maximum recursion depth, defined by a `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH` constant. If a `call_plan` directive would cause the stack depth to exceed this limit, the entire process MUST terminate with an error. This hard limit ensures that even with recursive or deeply nested plans, the system remains a **decidable**, non-Turing-complete process that is guaranteed to halt.

---

# Protocol: The Plan Registry

This protocol introduces a Plan Registry to create a more robust, modular, and discoverable system for hierarchical plans. It decouples the act of calling a plan from its physical file path, allowing plans to be referenced by a logical name.

## The Problem with Path-Based Calls

The initial implementation of the Context-Free Development Cycle (CFDC) relied on direct file paths (e.g., `call_plan path/to/plan.txt`). This is brittle:
- If a registered plan is moved or renamed, all plans that call it will break.
- It is difficult for an agent to discover and reuse existing, validated plans.

## The Solution: A Central Registry

The Plan Registry solves this by creating a single source of truth that maps logical, human-readable plan names to their corresponding file paths.

- **Location:** `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`
- **Format:** A simple JSON object of key-value pairs:
  ```json
  {
    "logical-name-1": "path/to/plan_1.txt",
    "run-all-tests": "plans/common/run_tests.txt"
  }
  ```

## Updated `call_plan` Logic

The `call_plan` directive is now significantly more powerful. When executing `call_plan <argument>`, the system will follow a **registry-first** approach:

1.  **Registry Lookup:** The system will first treat `<argument>` as a logical name and look it up in `knowledge_core/plan_registry.json`.
2.  **Path Fallback:** If the name is not found in the registry, the system will fall back to treating `<argument>` as a direct file path. This ensures full backward compatibility with existing plans.

## Management

A new tool, `tooling/plan_manager.py`, will be introduced to manage the registry with simple commands like `register`, `deregister`, and `list`, making it easy to maintain the library of reusable plans.

---

# Protocol: The Closed-Loop Self-Correction Cycle

This protocol describes the automated workflow that enables the agent to programmatically improve its own governing protocols based on new knowledge. It transforms the ad-hoc, manual process of learning into a reliable, machine-driven feedback loop.

## The Problem: The Open Loop

Previously, "lessons learned" were compiled into a simple markdown file, `knowledge_core/lessons_learned.md`. While this captured knowledge, it was a dead end. There was no automated process to translate these text-based insights into actual changes to the protocol source files. This required manual intervention, creating a significant bottleneck and a high risk of protocols becoming stale.

## The Solution: A Protocol-Driven Self-Correction (PDSC) Workflow

The PDSC workflow closes the feedback loop by introducing a set of new tools and structured data formats that allow the agent to enact its own improvements.

**1. Structured, Actionable Lessons (`knowledge_core/lessons.jsonl`):**
- Post-mortem analysis now generates lessons as structured JSON objects, not free-form text.
- Each lesson includes a machine-readable `action` field, which contains a specific, executable command.

**2. The Protocol Updater (`tooling/protocol_updater.py`):**
- A new, dedicated tool for programmatically modifying the protocol source files (`*.protocol.json`).
- It accepts commands like `add-tool`, allowing for precise, automated changes to protocol definitions.

**3. The Orchestrator (`tooling/self_correction_orchestrator.py`):**
- This script is the engine of the cycle. It reads `lessons.jsonl`, identifies pending lessons, and uses the `protocol_updater.py` to execute the defined actions.
- After applying a lesson, it updates the lesson's status, creating a clear audit trail.
- It finishes by running `make AGENTS.md` to ensure the changes are compiled into the live protocol.

This new, automated cycle—**Analyze -> Structure Lesson -> Execute Correction -> Re-compile Protocol**—is a fundamental step towards autonomous self-improvement.

# Protocol: Deep Research Cycle

This protocol defines a standardized, multi-step plan for conducting in-depth research on a complex topic. It is designed to be a reusable, callable plan that ensures a systematic and thorough investigation.

The cycle consists of five main phases:
1.  **Review Scanned Documents:** The agent first reviews the content of documents found in the repository during the initial scan. This provides immediate, project-specific context.
2.  **Initial Scoping & Keyword Generation:** Based on the initial topic and the information from scanned documents, the agent generates a set of search keywords.
3.  **Broad Information Gathering:** The agent uses the keywords to perform broad web searches and collect a list of relevant URLs.
4.  **Targeted Information Extraction:** The agent visits the most promising URLs to extract detailed information.
5.  **Synthesis & Summary:** The agent synthesizes the gathered information into a coherent summary, which is saved to a research report file.

This structured approach ensures that research is not ad-hoc but is instead a repeatable and verifiable process.

---

# Protocol: The Formal Research Cycle (L4)

This protocol establishes the L4 Deep Research Cycle, a specialized, self-contained Finite Development Cycle (FDC) designed for comprehensive knowledge acquisition. It elevates research from a simple tool-based action to a formal, verifiable process.

## The Problem: Ad-Hoc Research

Previously, research was an unstructured activity. The agent could use tools like `google_search` or `read_file`, but there was no formal process for planning, executing, and synthesizing complex research tasks. This made it difficult to tackle "unknown unknowns" in a reliable and auditable way.

## The Solution: A Dedicated Research FDC

The L4 Research Cycle solves this by introducing a new, specialized Finite State Machine (FSM) tailored specifically for research. When the main orchestrator (`master_control.py`) determines that a task requires deep knowledge, it initiates this cycle.

### Key Features:

1.  **Specialized FSM (`tooling/research_fsm.json`):** Unlike the generic development FSM, the research FSM has states that reflect a true research workflow: `GATHERING`, `SYNTHESIZING`, and `REPORTING`. This provides a more accurate model for the task.
2.  **Executable Plans:** The `tooling/research_planner.py` is upgraded to generate formal, executable plans that are validated against the new research FSM. These are no longer just templates but are verifiable artifacts that guide the agent through the research process.
3.  **Formal Invocation:** The L4 cycle is a first-class citizen in the agent's architecture. The main orchestrator can formally invoke it, execute the research plan, and then integrate the resulting knowledge back into its main task.

This new protocol provides a robust, reliable, and formally verifiable mechanism for the agent to explore complex topics, making it significantly more autonomous and capable.

# --- Child Module: `critic` ---

# Protocol: Critic `reset_all` Prohibition

This protocol establishes a critical safeguard to protect the integrity of the development workflow.

## Rule: `critic-no-reset`

The agent assigned the role of 'Code Review Critic' is explicitly and strictly forbidden from using the `reset_all` tool.

**Rationale:** The `reset_all` tool is a destructive action that reverts all changes in the workspace. Its use by a review agent could lead to the accidental deletion of work-in-progress, creating a significant disruption. This protocol ensures that the critic's function is limited to analysis and feedback, preventing it from taking destructive actions.

This prohibition is non-negotiable and must be adhered to by any agent assuming the 'Code Review Critic' role.

**Enforcement Mechanism:** The Code Review Critic is not implemented in this repository. Its behavior is governed by the compiled `AGENTS.md` file, which is consumed by an external orchestration system. The inclusion of this protocol in `AGENTS.md` constitutes the complete implementation of this safeguard from the perspective of this codebase.

---


---

# Protocol: The Context-Sensitive Development Cycle (CSDC)

This protocol introduces a new form of development cycle that is sensitive to the logical context in which it operates. It moves beyond the purely structural validation of the FDC and CFDC to incorporate constraints based on fundamental principles of logic and computability.

The CSDC is founded on the idea of exploring the trade-offs between expressive power and the risk of self-referential paradoxes. It achieves this by defining two mutually exclusive development models.

## Model A: The Introspective Model

- **Permits:** `define_set_of_names`
- **Forbids:** `define_diagonalization_function`

This model allows the system to have a complete map of its own language, enabling powerful introspection and metaprogramming. However, it explicitly forbids the diagonalization function, a common source of paradoxes in self-referential systems. This can be seen as a Gödel-like approach.

## Model B: The Self-Referential Model

- **Permits:** `define_diagonalization_function`
- **Forbids:** `define_set_of_names`

This model allows the system to define and use the diagonalization function, enabling direct self-reference. However, it prevents the system from having a complete name-map of its own expressions, which is another way to avoid paradox (related to Tarski's undefinability theorem).

## Complexity Classes

Both models can be further constrained by computational complexity:
- **Polynomial (P):** For plans that are considered computationally tractable.
- **Exponential (EXP):** For plans that may require significantly more resources, allowing for more complex but potentially less efficient solutions.

## The `csdc_cli.py` Tool

The CSDC is enforced by the `tooling/csdc_cli.py` tool. This tool validates a plan against a specified model and complexity class, ensuring that all constraints are met before execution.

---

# Protocol: Speculative Execution

This protocol empowers the agent to engage in creative and exploratory tasks when it is otherwise idle. It provides a formal framework for the agent to generate novel ideas, plans, or artifacts that are not direct responses to a user request, but are instead products of its own "imagination" and analysis of the repository.

The goal is to enable proactive, creative problem-solving and self-improvement, allowing the agent to "dream" productively within safe and well-defined boundaries.

## Rules

- **`idle-state-trigger`**: The Speculative Execution Protocol can only be invoked when the agent has no active, user-assigned task. This ensures that speculative work never interferes with primary duties.
- **`formal-proposal-required`**: The first action in any speculative task must be the creation of a formal proposal document. This document must outline the objective, rationale, and a detailed plan for the task.
- **`resource-constraints`**: All speculative tasks must operate under predefined resource constraints (e.g., time limits, computational resources) to prevent runaway processes.
- **`user-review-gate`**: The final output or artifact of a speculative task cannot be integrated or submitted directly. It must be presented to the user for formal review and approval.
- **`speculative-logging`**: All logs, artifacts, and actions generated during a speculative task must be clearly tagged with a `speculative` flag to distinguish them from standard, user-directed work.
