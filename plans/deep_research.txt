# Deep Research Plan
# This plan conducts research on a given topic and saves the findings.
# It expects the agent to have a `research_topic` variable in its state.

# Phase 1: Initial Scoping & Keyword Generation
# The agent should generate keywords based on the research topic.
# For this example, we'll use the topic directly as the search query.

google_search
<research_topic>

# Phase 2: Broad Information Gathering
# The agent would normally analyze the search results and select top URLs.
# For now, we'll simulate this by picking the first URL.
# The agent should store the URL in a variable, e.g., `target_url`.

# Phase 3: Targeted Information Extraction
# The agent visits the selected URL to get detailed information.

<target_url>

# Phase 4: Synthesis & Summary
# The agent synthesizes the findings and saves them to a report.
# The report will be named based on the research topic.
