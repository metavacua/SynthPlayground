# Proof-of-Concept Agent: Hello, World!
# This UDC plan defines an agent whose sole purpose is to greet the world.
# It demonstrates the core mechanic of agent construction: defining a program
# that can be executed by the UDC orchestrator.

# Call the 'hello_world' tool. The protocol requires the message "Hello, World!".
# Although the UDC orchestrator's CALL is a stub, this demonstrates the
# correct invocation according to the tool manifest.
CALL hello_world "Hello, World!"

# Halt the virtual machine. This signifies the successful completion of the agent's task.
